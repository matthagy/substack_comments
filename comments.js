But in neither case have Americans, either white or black, been willing to accept the means necessary to achieve these ends. This is what underlies the policy dilemmas that I have been trying to describe. The commitment to the preservation of a distinct African American culture and identity and the aversion to compulsory forms of inclusion have clearly worked at cross-purposes with the objectives specified by the integrationist ideal. Unwilling to decide which option to pursue, or more often, deeply divided over which option to pursue, African Americans have been unable to formulate a unified set of demands. Lack of direction from the black community has, in turn, generated near-complete paralysis on the issue among progressive whites. Absent any coherent policy agenda, white Americans have turned increasingly inward, toward extreme forms of confessional self\u2011criticism."

Lincoln swapped Hamlin for Johnson to help secure re-election, but in the end the 1864 election wasn\u2019t very close. The Lincoln-Hamlin ticket maybe wins a bit more narrowly but they still win.

The quality of economic data from this era is not great, but Andrew Jalil\u2019s paper on the history of American banking crises suggests it kicked off a pretty serious recession. Could this have been prevented? I don\u2019t know \u2014 historians seem a little uncertain as to why the panic happened at all. But Grant did veto a controversial piece of legislation in 1874 known as the Inflation Bill and the economy instead experienced deflation. Perhaps if they\u2019d given it a better name like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Grant would have signed it, the economy would have prospered, and the Reconstruction coalition would have stayed in place longer."

And the growth in soybean planting is all about exporting animal feed for Chinese pig farmers."

E.g., BloomTech (formerly Lambda School) is a software engineering bootcamp funded by ISAs.  Their ISA is something like 17% for 24 months once you make at least $50k, capped at a max total payment of $30k."

Laura and Matt do engage with that a bit towards the end of the episode, and they agree that it is unfortunate that Democrats have been losing working class voters, possibly due to culture war issues and a reduced focus on economic populism."

In the more conspiratorial tellings, this condemnation alleges that the Democratic party has been captured by the rich so that liberal proclivities could be redirected from redistributional economics onto identity and cultural issues. A more reasonable narrative is that these highly-educated professionals have a mix of liberal policy priorities that include both redistribution economics and civil rights issues."

In practice, you can\u2019t build a robust welfare state with taxes only focused on such a small group of taxpayers. There is a lot of income, financing a lot of private consumption, within the upper middle class, and we\u2019ll need to significantly increase taxes on that income band in order to redirect resources from private consumption into public services. A strong welfare state entails the reallocation of tangible resources (chiefly labor) and our taxes need to be structured accordingly."

There is a reason the New Deal coalition collapsed; chiefly the Republican\u2019s Southern strategy to win the white working class as Democrats fought for civil rights. Some have suggested that Democrats should focus solely on economic issues, but that ignores the very real interest in civil rights and cultural issues among many Democratic voters. Should some politicians ignore that, others will fill the void. For example, Clinton\u2019s embrace of identity issues in the 2016 primary election to outflank Sanders."

In 2003\u20132004, Berlin implemented a number of labor reforms\u2014referred to as the Hartz reforms\u2014whose net impact was to weaken the bargaining power of workers and substantially slow wage growth to well below GDP growth. When this happened, Germany\u2019s trade deficit became one of the largest surpluses in history as its unemployment level fell sharply.

The deficit forecast in 2011 increased to $1.42 trillion, up from the $1.27 estimate in February. For 2012, the deficit estimate rose to $922 billion, up from $828 billion in the previous report.

Obama would need resources to save G.M. and Chrysler, which were close to bankruptcy, and to address the collapsing housing market, which he was told would be hit with five million foreclosures during his first two years in office. Summers cautioned Obama, who had run as a fiscal conservative and attacked his Republican opponent for wanting to raise taxes, that he was about to preside over an explosion of government spending: \u201cThis could come as a considerable sticker shock to the American public and the American political system, potentially reducing your ability to pass your agenda and undermining economic confidence at a critical time.\u201d"

A Berkeley economist, she was new to government. She believed that she had persuaded Summers to raise the stimulus recommendation above the initial estimate, six hundred billion dollars, to something closer to eight hundred billion dollars, but she was frustrated that she wasn\u2019t allowed to present an even larger option. When she had done so in earlier meetings, the incoming chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, asked her, \u201cWhat are you smoking?\u201d She was warned that her credibility as an adviser would be damaged if she pushed beyond the consensus recommendation."

Instead, they\u2019re primary focus is on fundraising and volunteer recruiting. At times their best marketing strategy is to sell the argument for increasing prices by strangeling out domestic supply. At other times that argument is less palatable. This is no different from car manufacturers highlighting their fuel efficiency when gasoline prices are high and shifting to marketing other features when consumers aren\u2019t focused on prices of gasoline."

We should compare and contrast their marketing strategies through a capitalistic lens no different than how McKinsey would critique Coke\u2019s branding. We should offer advice on how they can create a better product to sell to their donors and suggest books on corporate marketing."

I worry that our highly visible elites will grow increasingly distant from the median Democratic voter (let alone the median voter in general) and this will be exploited by right wingers to pull away voters and possibly risk fracturing our broad coalition."

While details are still coming out, it already ranks among the most prominent corporate disasters of all time and has left the entire crypto community reeling. To better understand the role that FTX played in the industry and how the exchange started to unravel, we speak with two guests on this episode. First, we have Evgeny Gaevoy, the founder and CEO of the crypto market-making firm Wintermute, to explain how he used the FTX platform and how he understood its relationship with SBF's trading firm, Alameda Research. Then we speak with independent researcher James Block, author of the Dirty Bubble Media newsletter, and one of the first observers to blow the whistle on the FTX disaster."

History shows that the employment costs of bringing down inflation are likely to increase with delay, as high inflation becomes more entrenched in wage and price setting. The successful Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s followed multiple failed attempts to lower inflation over the previous 15 years. A lengthy period of very restrictive monetary policy was ultimately needed to stem the high inflation and start the process of getting inflation down to the low and stable levels that were the norm until the spring of last year. Our aim is to avoid that outcome by acting with resolve now."

Firms and their investors are currently skittish about aggressive investments due to the shale boom and bust of the mid 2010s. To protect them against collapsing fossil fuel prices the loans will include novel repayment credits. For example, any barrel of oil sold below $x will generate a credit equal to the difference between $x and the price, where x is something like $60/barrel. Therefore if fossil fuel prices collapse due to our massive investment then this will be a direct subsidy. Whereas if prices stay high then the government gets the loans paid back in full."

We have a certain natural level of performance, gravitate towards it early on, and are likely to remain in that band relative to peers until our education ends. There is some room for wiggle, and in large populations there are always outliers. But in thousands of years of education humanity has discovered no replicable and reliable means of taking kids from one educational percentile and raising them up into another. Mobility of individual students in quantitative academic metrics relative to their peers over time is far lower than popularly believed. The children identified as the smart kids early in elementary school will, with surprising regularity, maintain that position throughout schooling. Do some kids transcend (or fall from) their early positions? Sure. But the system as a whole is quite static. Most everybody stays in about the same place relative to peers over academic careers. The consequences of this are immense, as it is this relative position, not learning itself, which is rewarded economically and socially in our society."

This will be very hard to do! But I am not sure it is impossible. The task, really, is to lay out a reasonable-seeming story of how FTX\u2019s innocent choices led to its insolvency.

The rich already spend a disproportionately small portion of their income on consumption; the majority of their income is saved and invested. Increasing taxes may have some impact on their marginal consumption, but they could also just slightly decrease their savings rate. And if we continue to define rich as income in excess of $400k then we are only addressing a vanishingly small amount of consumption."

With less investment in the economy fewer new businesses will be created and thereby fewer new jobs. Similarly, existing businesses will be less able to raise capital to expand operations. Distressed businesses will find themselves unable to restructure their debt with new financing and will instead need to minimize their operations or possibly go out of business. All of this will slow the growth of the economy and loosen up the labor market. Note these mechanisms are the same ones impacted by raising interest rates and increasing the cost of capital."

We have a certain natural level of performance, gravitate towards it early on, and are likely to remain in that band relative to peers until our education ends. There is some room for wiggle, and in large populations there are always outliers. But in thousands of years of education humanity has discovered no replicable and reliable means of taking kids from one educational percentile and raising them up into another. Mobility of individual students in quantitative academic metrics relative to their peers over time is far lower than popularly believed. The children identified as the smart kids early in elementary school will, with surprising regularity, maintain that position throughout schooling. Do some kids transcend (or fall from) their early positions? Sure. But the system as a whole is quite static. Most everybody stays in about the same place relative to peers over academic careers. The consequences of this are immense, as it is this relative position, not learning itself, which is rewarded economically and socially in our society."

The mystery is all the more striking because the repeal was not done in the dead of night, like a congressional pay raise. It came at the end of a multiyear populist campaign launched by a few individuals, and was heralded by its supporters as a signal achievement for Americans who are committed to the work ethic and the American Dream."

This is a fraction of Facebook, half of Facebook Messenger, fewer than Instagram and not that much bigger than SnapChat; presuming the latter service passes Twitter later this year, Twitter will be only the 5th most popular U.S.-based social networking service looking to monetize through advertising.
