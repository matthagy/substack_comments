    "body":"Less of a question and more of a request to improve the Slow Boring paid-subscriber experience. Could we crowdfund an effort to organize your large archive of articles into an easily-browsable knowledge base for paid subscribers? You have a huge and valuable body of work here consisting of over 450 articles, but it can be difficult to browse the archive, particularly when focused on a specific topic. And such a knowledge base would be a major benefit to entice new paid subscribers who wanna get Yglesias-pilled.\n\nI\u2019m imagining an Yglesiaspedia that organizes and briefly summarizes your major ideas, links to the most significant articles, and includes some quoted excerpts. Like could we pay a few college students $20\/hr to put this together with minimal review from you and other Slow Boring staff? (Or I guess some of us could volunteer to do the work, although I see a major time\/money arbitrage opportunity with college kids.)\n\nNot sure how we\u2019d limit this valuable resource to paid subscribers only, but maybe Substack staff could figure out a solution and justify their exorbitant 10% cut. Could even just be a bunch of paid-only Substack articles that link to each other, are occasionally updated, and neither show up in the main feed nor are sent out over email.\n\nI personally desire this sufficiently that I tried organizing Slow Boring articles by algorithmic categorization, but the results are clunky and underwhelming. [1] I\u2019d much rather contribute some funding towards human curation and get a far superior result. \n\n[1] https:\/\/matthagy.github.io\/slowboring_article_clusters\/ (Only includes publicly available info like article titles and number of likes; not leaking paid subscriber content here.)"

    "body":"Yglesias has covered deficits and federal debt in a few articles. I think he isn't too worried about rising rates because Democrats have a better austerity solution than Republicans in that we can just increase taxes on the rich. I think this covered in \"The once and future politics of the national debt\",  https:\/\/www.slowboring.com\/p\/debt-politics\n\nComments on that article include a long thread where some readers point out that this may not be so simple. [1] Chiefly the required funding to cover interest payments and close the deficit could far exceed when any reasonable taxes on the top 1% could ever raise. Further, in such a fiscal crisis environment the income and wealth of the richest could be greatly impaired. Hence, we could be in a no win situation where both broad tax increases are required as well as deep spending cuts.\n\n[1] https:\/\/www.slowboring.com\/p\/debt-politics\/comment\/2570548"

    "body":"I think the key question is whether or not the European Central Bank can raise rates while making other interventions that prevent Italian bond yields from rising too far above other government's bonds. E.g., the Italy-Germany 10 year bond spread is currently around 2.2%, which is already a substantial rise from the ~1% spread seen throughout the pandemic. [1]\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde announced an intention to control this spread using some new, yet to be developed, tool. Bloomberg has a good overview on how this could work. [2]\n\n> The European Central Bank has sought to stave off the danger of a sovereign-debt storm with the promise of a new tool to curb market stress after Italian bond yields breached 4% on June 14, the highest since the market turmoil of 2014. Investors are viewing the renewed push to tackle so-called fragmentation as evidence policy makers will fight to prevent borrowing costs in the union from diverging excessively. That\u2019s a dynamic that threatened to rip the euro-zone apart during the crisis a decade ago.\n\nThe risk is that other countries, chiefly Germany, may disapprove of this plan since it appears that the ECB will be monetizing Italian debt at the expense of addressing the eurozone's inflationary problems. This potential conflict would be similar to the 2010\u2019s European debt crisis, [3] where southern states, particularly Greece, needed monetary intervention or debt restructuring and northern states like Germany opposed such measures and dragged their feet until it looked like the eurozone was gonna disintegrate.\n\n[1] https:\/\/ycharts.com\/indicators\/italygermany_10_year_bond_spread\n[2] https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-06-17\/why-the-ecb-needs-new-tools-for-bond-fragmentation-quicktake\n[3] https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/European_debt_crisis"

    "body":"Crude oil prices only partially explain the high gasoline prices. Another major issue is insufficient refinery capacity to convert crude oil into refined products like gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. As a result, these refined products are trading at much higher prices than would be expected from current crude prices. Javier Blas covered this issue in his May 9th article, \u201cSorry, But for You, Oil Trades at $250 a Barrel\u201d. [1]\n\n> If you are the owner of an oil refinery, then crude is trading happily just a little above $110 a barrel \u2014 expensive, but not extortionate. If you aren\u2019t an oil baron, I have bad news: it's as if oil is trading somewhere between $150 and $275 a barrel.\n\n> From 1985 to 2021, the crack spread averaged about $10.50 a barrel. Even between 2004 and 2008, during the so-called golden age of refining, the crack spread never surpassed $30. It rarely spent more than a few weeks above $20. Last week, however, the margin jumped to a record high of nearly $55. Crack margins for diesel and other petroleum products surged much higher. \n\n> Third, and perhaps most importantly, refining capacity has declined where it matters for the market now, and the plants that are operating are struggling to process enough crude to satisfy the demand for fuel. Martijn Rats, an oil analyst at Morgan Stanley, estimates that outside China and the Middle East, oil distillation capacity fell by 1.9 million barrels a day from the end of 2019 to today \u2014 that\u2019s the largest decline in 30 years.\n\n> The downward trend started well before the pandemic hit, as old Western refineries struggled to compete, environmental regulations increased costs and the unfounded fear of peak oil demand amid the energy transition prompted some companies to close plants. The fuel-demand collapse triggered by Covid-19 only turbo-charged the trend, resulting in dozens of refinery operations shutting down for good in Europe and the U.S. in 2020 and 2021.\n\n[1] https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/opinion\/articles\/2022-05-09\/crude-hovers-at-110-a-barrel-but-the-refinery-margin-makes-us-pay-a-lot-more"

    "body":"As Yglesias has said repeatedly, a lot of this comes down to Democrat staffers being far more progressive than the median Democrat voter; let alone the median voter. This strong bias filters what accomplishments that they focus on and shapes their own perception of events. The result is counterproductive messaging.\n\nI\u2019ve been hoping that fear of electoral victories for Trump and his compatriot politicians would focus Democrat staffers on winning at all costs; even if that meant compromising and moderating on policy and messaging. My personal thinking has definitely been influenced that way. It\u2019s one thing to lose due overly ambitious political goals when the downside is four years of Romney and a Republican congress cutting taxes and deregulating. When it's Trumpism the cost of losing is higher.\n\nYet such a change in strategy and tactics among Democrat staffers hasn't happened. And I think a lot of that can be attributed to the \u201cprogressive mobilization\u201d delusion. As long as staffers and activists continue to believe that there is a large number of demotivated potential voters yearning for revolutionary progressive changes then I don\u2019t think we'll have a more productive messaging discipline. We need to do anything and everything that we can do to push back on this false narrative and correct staffers\u2019 mental model of the American electoral landscape."

    "body":"I think any analysis of the counterproductive actions of activists needs to take into account their incentives. Activist groups are not necessarily primarily incentivized to work towards likely progress on their stated aims. Instead, their chief interest is fundraising. Those two aims can align at times\u2014particularly when donors prioritize outcomes\u2014but they don\u2019t have to. At times donors themselves may care more about supporting ideological purist movements that reinforce the donor\u2019s personal identity than a boring pragmatic cause.\n\nHence, activists can be incentivized to create the most compelling ideological product to sell to donors. Further, they need to differentiate themselves from competing activism products by developing a unique brand. And of course they want to maximize their courting of free media coverage, including distribution on social media. That can incentivize taking extreme and outrageous positions that are more likely to garner engagement.\n\nOne needn\u2019t even assume activist leadership is deliberately scheming to craft optimal ideological products for sale to donors. Market forces alone could ensure that more compelling and engaging movements outcompete lesser ones and thereby garner more funds for continuation and expansion. Through this Darwinian evolution we\u2019d be left with ideological products optimized for donor consumption."

    "body":"As detailed in The Overshoot article linked in this Slow Boring piece, [1] the US could fully replace the lost Russian and Ukrainian wheat imports with current agriculture productivity. The issue is that US farming has pivoted away from wheat and to corn and soybeans. The shift to corn is particularly concerning as the increased crop is primarily used for dubious ethanol production to use in fuel. And the growth in soybean planting is all about exporting animal feed for Chinese pig farmers.\n\n> Longer-term, the U.S. is the natural candidate to fill in for Russia\u2019s missing wheat surplus. American farmers spent the past several decades replacing wheat fields with corn and soybeans. The area harvested for wheat in the U.S. has shrunk by more than 40% since 1997 (from 25.4 million hectares to 15 million hectares), while land harvested for corn is up by 17.5% (from 29.4 million hectares to 34.6 million hectares) and land harvested for soybeans is up by 25% (from 28 million hectares to 35 million hectares).\n\n> If U.S. wheat acreage had remained constant and productivity had followed the same upward path, U.S. farmers would be harvesting about 32 additional megatons of wheat each year right now. That would be roughly enough to offset the loss of Russian exports. The transition might take a few years, but it should be achievable using the full array of tools present in the typical U.S. farm bill.\n\n[1] https:\/\/theovershoot.co\/p\/russias-attack-on-the-worlds-food"

As shown in this article, China is a major wheat importer. Hence their massive reserves serve as a buffer against global crises and trade wars.\n\nIt\u2019s possible some African and Middle Eastern nations might be able to make major geopolitical concessions to China in return for desperately needed food.

    "body":"From my experience living in SF for 5 years, I just don\u2019t think that the most visible and problematic homeless individuals could be moved from a tent on the street to an SRO to address their problems. These individuals with severe mental health or drug addiction issues aren\u2019t going to be cured just by moving off the street. Further, they\u2019ll still need to panhandler or steal to continue to make ends meet; particularly funding their drug use. And that is the behavior that everyone wants to see addressed.\n\nI believe that any plan to address homelessness needs to make a clear differentiation between these two different groups of people since the socially disruptive group is the one that most residents have in mind when discussing homelessness. SROs can certainly help the people that are just downtrodden and need a cheap place to live. The individuals with severe mental health or addiction issues need another plan. A plan that likely involves coercion into treatment and in some cases institutionalization. I think making a strong distinction between the two populations of homeless individuals will be helpful in pushing for zoning changes that help the individuals that are just downtrodden."

I think relying on \u201cone of the good things about America\u2019s urban urban electorate is that we are simply too squishy and liberal\u201d is insufficient. Opposition need not directly state their visceral dislike to living among the downtrodden that would reside in the new SROs. Instead, they can oppose it on numerous other grounds. E.g., the limited accommodations of an SRO are inhumane, private ownership of SROs would lead to capitalistic exploitation of societies most vulnerable, SROs operators would ruthlessly turn away anyone with mental health or drug addiction issues.\n\nOne idea is to argue for both public and private SROs simultaneously. The publicly owned and operated SROs would address anticapitalism and discrimination concerns. And they offer more accomidnations than shelters while being cheaper than providing full apartments. Once public SROs are begrudgingly accepted, then private SROs can be defended as providing accommodations for the less downtrodden that would like to spend less of their limited paycheck on housing."

Hence a profitable company with no debt likely has a non-optimal capital structure from a tax perspective, where capital structure refers to financing via debt (bonds) vs equity (stock). There may be a good justification for why interest should be a pre-tax expense in at least some cases, but the result is that corporate accountants will be failing shareholders if they don't find the optimal level of debt for a given corp's cash flow.\n\nThat can involve issuing bonds even when there is no need for the cash. And when a corp has cash that it cannot productively spend then it should return the cash to shareholders via either dividends or share buybacks. It may never make sense to use post-tax earnings to pay down the principal and the corp will keep rolling over its bonds despite being able to pay down the debt. Because, again, there is some optimal level of debt for the corp to hold.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly more nuance here than I understand since I have a very amateur understanding of corp finance.\n\n*edited for typo"

There wasn\u2019t sufficient consensus to send a recommendation to Congress and the recommendation was controversial. From Wikipedia [1]\n\n> The Commission's recommendations were politically controversial. Under the executive order that created the commission, a supermajority of 14 of the 18 commissioners had to agree to a recommendation before it was sent to Congress for a vote. In a vote in December 2010, the commission fell short of that requirement, with only 11 out of the 18 commissioners (five Republicans, five Democrats, and one independent) voting to endorse the commission's blueprint.\n\n> Critics on the left, such as Democratic Representative Jan Schakowsky (a Commission member) and Paul Krugman, opposed the Simpson\u2013Bowles proposal because it would cut entitlement and social safety net programs, including Social Security and Medicare. Critics on the right, such as Republican commission members Paul Ryan, Jeb Hensarling, and Dave Camp, and anti-tax activist Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform, objected to the Simpson-Bowles proposal because it would raise taxes.\n\nI could see a commission on college costs similarly devolving into partisan fighting with Democrats focusing on insufficient public funding and Republicans focusing on administrative bloat (particularly things like DEI officers). In the unlikely event the commission found some boring middle ground consensus, then I don\u2019t think anyone would pay any attention.\n\n[1] https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/National_Commission_on_Fiscal_Responsibility_and_Reform"

In this model, the school or another private entity agrees to pay for the students education in return for a percent of the students future earnings above some minimal salary and a fixed max repayment. E.g., BloomTech (formerly Lambda School) is a software engineering bootcamp funded by ISAs.  Their ISA is something like 17% for 24 months once you make at least $50k, capped at a max total payment of $30k.\n\nThis gives the educational institute a strong financial incentive to ensure their students succeed professionally. Further, it de-risks the financial obligations for the students. For students with the best outcomes, they\u2019d likely be better off with self-funding, possibly through loans, since they\u2019ll end up paying the maximum amount. Yet all students remove any risk of long term debt obligations. In some ways, this is similar to Substack\u2019s author incentive that guarantees a minimum income, but also minimizes the upside for the most successful.\n\nThe federal and state governments could still subsidize education with insufficient financial prospects, but that should be done explicitly and deliberately through grants. This then becomes a political decision about which studies should be subsidized and to what extent do we want to subsidize them. Regardless, no one should face financial ruin because a university scammed them into a financially disastrous education program."

[1] They\u2019ve certainly gotten flak for minimizing their own economic exposure, but as detailed in that link the investors value the ISAs based upon historical performance of the BloomTech\u2019s students. I.e., the better BloomTech does at placing students, the higher the financial value of future ISA sales.\n\nThis financing model makes sense to me since BloomTech and other schools need money up front to pay their staff and other operating expenses. The firm\u2019s equity investors don\u2019t want to see their funds used for debt offering, particularly because the company will have to keep selling stock to increase their balance sheet as the program grows in size. Instead, other investors with different financial  goals can provide this funding for a fixed income product (i.e., bond investors). These investors in the ISAs can use the historical financial outcomes of students, along with their beliefs about future economics of the industry to value the ISAs.\n\n[1] https:\/\/www.bloomtech.com\/article\/announcing-our-new-isa-financing-blueprint-and-100m-in-new-financing"

I personally took a similar path, computational chem Ph.D. to tech industry, and I am grateful that I had the option. I and many of my friends considered these alternative career paths when deciding whether or not to pursue grad school. The alternatives certainly de-risked the choice of pursuing a highly specialized and esoteric speciality career path; a career path that can be easily crushed with changes in federal funding research priorities. I probably would not have gone to grad school if I wasn\u2019t well aware of the wallstreet alternative career option and am thankful that the explosive growth in the tech industry has opened up additional options.\n\nIt is well known that academia produces way more STEM Ph.D.s than can be supported by long term stable career paths. These grad students are the workhorses of research and are essential for making scientific progress. Yet we all know that our prospects of gainful employment as researchers are slim at best. There\u2019s a lot of risk and uncertainty in research and even the brightest and hardest working researchers can find themselves sinking years into research endeavors that yield little of significance. Conversely, some people get lucky in being in the right place at the right time. No individual student can know how their research line will pan out and we can manage the downside risk by having these alternative career paths."

Adding a 1-2% yearly set aside for maintenance and repairs, including special assessments, and the cost of ownership can exceed renting.\n\nOf course this is comparing owning more housing to renting less.

I am hoping this is a long and slow process that keeps Republicans divided and further underperforming in elections.\n\nIn many ways, the anti-abortion activists remind me of some counterproductive climate activists that we Democrats have to deal with. E.g., activists that aim to end fossil fuel production in the US despite the fact the resulting surge in gas prices would be incredibly unpopular. From my poorly informed perspective, it appears the Republicans are doing a worse job managing their unpopular activists, with anti-abortion activists having a bigger seat at the table in developing Republican policy.\n\nI am curious how Republicans will reconcile this issue within their party. Anti-abortion activists hold deep moral convictions\u2014commonly informed by religion\u2014and I don\u2019t see how Republicans could ever reason with them. Yet I do wonder if these anti-abortion activists are sufficiently pragmatic to see how their deeply unpopular, extremist views could never be encoded in federal law. E.g., the whole personhood for fetuses amendment that some Republicans suggest. If so, Republicans may be able to bring them on board for a more moderate abortion policy position. Alternatively, if the activists lack such pragmatism, then Republicans could be in a world of hurt."

I worry that could aid in uniting those two Republican factions into putting up a united front against Biden and Democrats.\n\nInstead, I think we should aim to keep these two Republican factions divided. There are MAGA Republicans that oppose abortion bans (e.g., the barstool conservatives that like the strongman, America first stuff, but are still quite socially liberal). And there are anti-abortion Republicans that are horrified by Trump\u2019s anti-democratic aims, authoritarian impulses, and overall disguisting behavior (e.g., the never-Trump, religious right like David French).\n\nIn general, I think this Republican civil war is beneficial for Democrats and therefore we should fan the flames and keep these two factions fighting. Further, we should also offer the Democratic party as an alternative for Republicans that are in favor of at least one flavor of Republican extremism but horrified by the other. They needn\u2019t drop their political convictions to at least temporarily vote Democrat."

The most recent Trustees Report anticipates insufficient funding starting in 2034. [1]\n\nThe most straightforward solution is to increase (or eliminate) the current payroll tax ceiling of $147k. But many Democratic politicians have decided that increasing taxes on anyone earning less than $400k is politically untenable. So they might have to propose making payroll taxes progressive or funding out of the general fund. And the recent BBB\/IRA legislation fiasco shows how hard it is for Democrats to reach a consensus to raise any taxes.\n\nRegardless of approach, it would require Democrats to champion a substantial tax increase\u2014possibly including incomes below $400k\u2014without any commensurate new benefits. Or they\u2019d have to give ground to the Republicans and propose some benefits cuts such as increasing the retirement age for future beneficiaries.\n\nI could see Republican welfare critics potentially garnering more support when their solutions are contrasted against alternative approaches that will allow the programs to be sustained.

    "body":"I agree with these reforms for teacher compensation and career paths. And I think they highlight a more general problem with a lot of public employment. We offer government workers lower salaries in exchange for higher job security and heavily back loaded compensation in the form of defined benefit pensions.\n\nThis employment arrangement is tempting for governments because it offers lower immediate costs in a current budget. But it\u2019s penny wise and pound foolish in multiple ways. First, as discussed in this article, it filters out many potential employees who can get higher initial compensation elsewhere. Next, it leads to government employees fighting for excessively strong protections against getting fired.\n\nFurther, the backloaded defined benefits can financially cripple a government when these future liabilities are not sufficiently prefunded. And it\u2019s always tempting to underfund to again keep the current budget lower. This can result in a growing financial burden as the liabilities come due and new tax revenue is needed to make up for the insufficient pension funds. The new taxes without a compensatory increase in services can lead residents to flee to lower tax jurisdictions which only compounds the problem. This doom loop can crush a city (and possibly one day a state).\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d like to see all defined benefit pensions being outlawed since they have such perverse incentives to incur future liabilities without sufficient current outlays to fund them. Even when attempting to prefund liabilities with a pension fund there is always a temptation to assume overly optimistic returns from the investments in this fund. Since no one can predict the future of financial markets (nor the costs of future benefits like healthcare), governments can\u2019t avoid the risk of these liabilities exceeding assets."

    "body":"What do we want from higher caliber teachers?\n\nI don\u2019t think we want teachers that are skilled at developing curriculum since it seems incredibly inefficient for each teacher to create their own. Instead, it seems curriculum development should be centralized with a small number of professionals developing textbooks and outline of lesson plans.\n\nMaybe better lecturers? That again seems inefficient since we could instead have a small number of exceptional lecturers record presentations. The Khan Academy model seems quite enticing in that respect in that it assigns recorded lectures as homework and then uses class time for collaborative work on problem sets with help from the teacher and fellow students.\n\nDo we just need them to maintain classroom order among a bunch of children? That certainly seems important, although I\u2019m not sure that skillset is associated with higher SAT scores. I wouldn\u2019t expect workers with exceptional talents in that area to have many other opportunities for alternative careers leveraging those skills.\n\nI do agree that some teachers are better than others. And further agree that we should pay a premium for that. Yet I\u2019m not convinced we need to lure workers from other potential higher-paying career paths."

I think that incorrectly separates the rational mind from irrational impulses. Instead, I believe the mind is a combination of conscious thinking and subconscious impulses, with the latter including emotions and intuitions. There can commonly be conflicts between the two, but neither is more authentic.\n\nIn terms of addressing the conflict, I believe the rational mind can construct a better environment for the subconscious mind to operate into. For example, to consume a healthy diet I don\u2019t keep any snacks nor alcohol in my home to remove these temptations. I also do a fair amount of meal planning to minimize the risk of overeating. As a result, I don\u2019t find much of a conscious\/unconscious conflict with regard to diet since the environment in which my subconscious operates doesn\u2019t include these unhealthy temptations.\n\n*edited to add quoted text"

Yet the Fed cannot unilaterally ignore its Congressional mandate in an attempt to address these broader interests beyond its purview. E.g., it cannot pursue monetary policy coordination with other central banks.\n\nThe US can address these issues but should do so primarily through the Treasury Dept, particularly through its exchange stabilization fund. [1] Working in coordination with the fiscal authorities of other nations and the IMF, the Treasury could pursue a systemic devaluation of the dollar against other currencies. Based on the scale of the intervention, Congressional action may be needed to increase the available funds. E.g., authorizing more borrowing so that the Treasury can sell more dollars for other currencies.\n\nThe 1985 Plaza Accord is an example of the US Treasury working in coordination with other nations to achieve such a dollar devaluation. [2] Yet in our current high-inflation environment such an intervention would be incredibly unpopular. The historical analogous Plaza Accord was only possible after the Fed had sufficiently vanquished inflation earlier in the 80s. Similar to today, the dollar appreciated significantly throughout this hawkish monetary policy, yet US domestic politics could not consider the broader implications until inflation was addressed.\n\n[1] https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Exchange_Stabilization_Fund\n\n[2] https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Plaza_Accord\n"

If he appears to be sidelining the progressives, even out of political pragmatism to achieve some of their policy goals, then we could risk voter apathy going forward from progressives. Worse, we could risk a fracturing of the Dem party with the progressive splitting out into their own party. This would ensure Repub victories for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn general, I get the impression that both the Dem and Repub leadership are struggling to keep their broad coalitions united. Much of this could be attributed to social media that amplifies the most online and extreme voices. Further, mainstream media commonly bolsters the reach of these extreme positions to moderate compatriots and also ensures that the opposition is well aware of their extremist opponents. The result is an extremely wide overton window and both parties struggle to occupy enough of it to win elections.\n\nHistorically, party leadership had much more control over the messaging. So while each party may have still contained some extremists, the extremist views had limited reach. The party could be focused on a strategic portion of the overton window knowing that extremists would naturally gravitate towards the more moderate party on their side. Party leadership chiefly concerned themselves with swing voters who were sympathetic to some issues on each side of the partisan divide."

[1] From that article\n\n> That is partly because the lowest-income filers are the ones getting the most enforcement: Households poor enough to receive the earned-income tax credit are five times more likely to be audited than higher-earning filers, according to research released by Syracuse University\u2019s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve read, EITC audits are pretty simple and result from automatically detectable errors. A common example is two tax filers both claiming the same dependent child. This is trivially easy for the IRS to detect since you have to list the SSN of claimed dependents. And the IRS has found that EITC errors are quite common. [2]\n\n> Over 26 million taxpayers receive over $64 billion in EITC benefits. The National Research Program (NRP) estimates that approximately 50% of EITC claims have errors and the $18.1 billion improper payments account for almost half of the $40 billion portion of the tax gap attributable to credits.\n\n> In FY 2017, risk-based scoring identified about 6.4 million returns as claiming a potentially erroneous EITC due to a qualifying child issue or misreported income.\n\n> The IRS planned to audit approximately 300,000 EITC returns for over the past 5 years and plans to continue to audit about 300,000 returns each year in the future. EITC correspondence audits are the most efficient use of available IRS examination resources with the average time to complete the audit of 5 hours per return.\n\nFurther, almost all EITC audits are correspondence audits; a small-scale audit where the IRS mails a form explaining the issue and asks the filer to either provide some proof or pay the difference of a revised tax filing. [3] These don\u2019t take a lot of time and further provide the necessary clarification to prevent the same mistake in the future.\n\nThere is still a lot that could be done in terms of tax filer education, or even better an IRS-funded tax filing website. Similarly, with more funding for customer support the IRS will be able to provide more time in answering questions and helping people file the correct taxes initially. Here\u2019s a good critical review of EITC audits and proposals for improvements, The Long Read: Auditing earned income,  https:\/\/tax.thomsonreuters.com\/news\/the-long-read-auditing-earned-income\/\n\n[1] https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/opinions\/2022\/04\/15\/frustrated-with-irs-call-republican\/\n\n[2] https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/newsroom\/irs-update-on-audits\n\n[3] https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/charities-non-profits\/correspondence-audit"

    "body":"I think Ben Thompson described an interesting plan for addressing Twitter\u2019s content moderation and financial model on Apr 18 in his article, \u201cBack to the Future of Twitter\u201d. [1] His basic idea is to separate Twitter into a backend service that hosts content and a front end client that provides moderation and algorithmic amplification. Twitter would then open the backend up so that anyone can develop their own client by paying for access.\n\nThe backend would do the minimal amount of moderation necessary to conform with the law in each jurisdiction and then provide optional services to the clients for more sophisticated moderation and algorithmic ranking. Twitter would continue to host their existing front end and possibly create more over time.\n\nThe idea is that the plethora of clients would allow for experimentation and meeting the diverse user preferences. You could have heavily moderated clients as well as wild west anything goes. While all clients would reference the same social graph and tweets\/replies, each client could use whatever methods they want for filtering and ranking.\n\nSome possible clients I\u2019ve considered.\n\n1. A client geared towards journalists and other prominent people that provides them with a layer that filters out harassment. This could include manual curation of their DMs, replies and retweets. The service would also have a team of lawyers for reporting credible threats of violence to law enforcement and sending cease-and-desist letters for proper libel. (Note this works well with Elon\u2019s plan to require human identity verification, even for anonymous accounts.) This service would be expensive and geared towards people that value this layer of protection for professional reasons.\n\n2. A client geared towards techies like myself that want to experiment with their own algorithms. While we\u2019re a niche group, many of us would gladly pay quite a bit of money to support such a nerdy hobby.

We should all act as if anything we say on the public internet will be preserved for eternity, and if scandalous in the future then it will surface.\n\nOn a related tangent, I think everyone should also act as if everything they say online can and will be tied to their public real identity. The OPSEC necessary to ensure an anonymous account can never be tied to ones real identity is higher than most people realize. Just one sloppy mistake can deanonymize an account. For many people this could be something as basic as forgetting which account they are on saying something that provides a connection.\n\nHence, I recommend everyone always use their real name so they're not tempted to say something that would embarrass them should it be tied back to their real identity."

    "body":"I absolutely agree! I fear that there has been some sort of mission merging within various left-leaning causes, including this example of climate change and anticapitalism. To some extent, I believe this is due to increasing political polarization and belief sorting. There\u2019s now a basket of linked beliefs in each political group and there\u2019s strong pressure to accept all of these beliefs in order to be a member of that group. To dissent on a single belief is to attract ingroup attacks from one's compatriots.\n\nI find the merging and climate and anticapitalism beliefs to be particularly dangerous for our long term prospects of combating climate change. Capitalism is simply the dominant socioeconomic order around the globe for all production of any significance. All plausible solutions to climate change will involve capitalist production and profit. E.g., production of solar cells, wind turbines, batteries, and transmission infrastructure. Many investors, entrepreneurs, and executives will collectively make massive wealth gains as we hopefully accelerate the transition to clean energy. We might even see Elon Musk becoming a trillionaire should Tesla play a larger role in these solutions.\n\nYet there are many climate activists that would find such profiteering on climate solutions ghastly. I fear such activists could even become an impediment to climate change progress as they increasingly attack the firms and individuals producing climate change solutions. While there are certainly good-faith critiques of the current capitalistic order and wealth inequality, those concerns should ideally be separated from climate change. We can tackle capitalism reforms\/regulations and redistributive tax policies in separate discussions that address the general problem without linking those issues to climate change.\n\nUnfortunately it wouldn\u2019t surprise me to see these issues increasingly linked in the future. You can see this with the proposed supplement tax credit for EVs produced by union labor. Additional linking in future legislation could greatly impede progress of addressing climate change. Yet for many supposed climate change activists this would be acceptable, possibly even preferable, to an alternative where capitalists profit off accelerated progress of addressing climate change."

Because, as Roberts explains, the activists are not incentivized towards increasing the price of oil to decrease carbon emissions. Instead, they\u2019re primary focus is on fundraising and volunteer recruiting. At times their best marketing strategy is to sell the argument for increasing prices by strangeling out domestic supply. At other times that argument is less palatable. This is no different from car manufacturers highlighting their fuel efficiency when gasoline prices are high and shifting to marketing other features when consumers aren\u2019t focused on prices of gasoline.\n\nAt the end of the day, we need to accept that activists of all stripes are first and foremost focused on fundraising. I actually think there is a productive line of attack against counterproductive lefits NGOs based around this truth. Rather than attacking supply-side climate activists for their poor approach to limiting emissions, we should instead praise them for their innovative and effective marketing campaign. We should compare and contrast their marketing strategies through a capitalistic lens no different than how McKinsey would critique Coke\u2019s branding. We should offer advice on how they can create a better product to sell to their donors and suggest books on corporate marketing."

I just think that there is too much uncertainty and downside risk as we transition to green energy.\n\nAfterall, how many of us would be willing to invest a non-trivial portion of our networth into a new domestic fossil fuel project that doesn\u2019t plan to start generating cash for 2 to 10 years? Putting aside the morality concerns around investing in fossil fuels (a la ESG investing), does it look like a lucrative bet? What is the risk we end up in another oil boom and best similar to the 2015 shale financial implosion? Could OPEC+ choose to increase production to again strangle out the US oil industry? What does the regulatory future look like? To what extent will green energy get increasingly cheaper and crowd out fossil fuels even without government action?.\n\nI personally can\u2019t see domestic fossil fuels being a good investment without some massive changes in market factors. We could implement Yglesias\u2019s idea for decreasing oil volatility by massively expanding the strategic petroleum reserve to soak up domestic oil when it\u2019s cheap and sell it into the market when it gets expensive. [1] But I just don\u2019t think the political calculus will work out.\n\nClimate activists will be outraged by this plan to encourage more domestic fossil fuel production through what is essentially an industrial subsidy. Voters may like the idea in theory, but right wing populists will criticize the plan to artificially raise the price of oil when supply is abundant. They\u2019ll call it a backdoor carbon tax, which is not inaccurate. Worse of all, if the US government introduces a mechanism to control the price of oil then there will be political pressure to keep the price low. Now that the president actually has a lever to control the price of gasoline they\u2019ll always be compelled to shift the prices lower.\n\n[1] https:\/\/www.slowboring.com\/p\/america-needs-an-actual-plan-to-boost?s=r"

Afterall, why add a tax just so that we can send the money back to the taxpayer?\n\nAnd there still are distributional issues beyond the regressive tax. Many people living in rural areas that rely on a lot of driving will be paying more in carbon taxes than they receive in dividends. Conversely, city dwellers that take public transit will get more in dividends than they pay through carbon taxes. Yes, that is what we want to encourage less consumption of fossil fuels.

    "body":"> I\u2019m not exactly sure why this happened, but roughly a year ago there was a substantial vibe shift in Silicon Valley which holds that most large technology companies are massively overstaffed.\n\nMany, if not most, tech companies are extremely reluctant to fire engineers for performance reasons until they run into a cash flow issue and have to do layoffs. You\u2019ll find this general consensus across tech forums (e.g., Hackers News). I believe this is the case for a multitude of reasons.\n\nFirst, engineers are among the most expensive employees to hire and onboard. A lot of resources go into recruiting, including numerous interviews with existing engineers and managers. And many candidates get rejected or reject the company. This adds up to a lot of time and money (guessing high 5 figures) just to hire one engineer.\n\nFurther, it can take months for an engineer to get up to speed at an established company due to all of the proprietary tech and knowledge. And engineers grow in value for years as they pick up more tribal knowledge of the firm\u2019s codebase and systems.\n\nSecond, engineers on the same team become non-fungible due to working on different projects. We certainly try to minimize this by rotating people on to different projects so that they can gain more tribal knowledge. Yet every team member becomes the canonical expert on different systems since they simply have worked on different projects.\n\nThird, there rarely is any short term value to firing a low performing engineer. Yes, some of us are an actual net negative by worsening the codebase quality or breaking things that require other people\u2019s help to fix. Yet that is rare. More likely is a \u201cquiet quitter\u201d that makes some minimal, yet positive contribution. You\u2019ll find numerous self-reporting on Hacker News of engineers only working 10 hours a week at FAANG firms.\n\nFourth, engineers have short tenures, commonly jumping to another firm in two years. It\u2019s an open secret that an internal promotion at almost all tech companies is harder than simply getting hired at that higher level at a comparable firm. There\u2019s a lot of debate among engineers about whether that is due to a failure of internal promotion processes or a failure of the hiring processes. And of course the most ambitious and highest performers are jumping firms more frequently.\n\nSo in summary, engineers are expensive to hire, possess valuable differential tribal knowledge, are almost always a positive contribution to the team, and constantly leaving anyways. So there\u2019s just no reason to manage out low performers unless the firm runs into cash flow issues."

Contemporary tech is just too incentivized around growth over margins; until recently it has been growth at all costs.\n\nOne could argue that the rigorous barriers to internal promotion partially address the issue. We simply have way more info about current employees relative to potential hires. If someone is barely performing at their current level then their manager can at least withhold promotion. Whereas on the hiring side we all gotta make our best guess and aren\u2019t incentivized to correct mistakes.\n\nAs an aside, I have gotten to work with an old school tech team when the startup that I was at got reverse acquired by a firm founded in the 60s. (I.e., parent company moved assets and teams to us and then sold everything else\u2014including the parent company\u2019s name\u2014to another firm.) That team had what I\u2019d consider a culture of costs and benefits rather than growth at all costs. They had been through layoffs and recognized the value in managing out low performers to control their costs.\n\nIn merging into the eng org, the OGs adopted its tech culture for compatability, although they could certainly joke about some of the absurdities. Yet I imagine they all still have their hard-learned lessons, and it\u2019s not surprising that their top manager eventually became the VP of engineering a few years post-merge. I imagine that eng org is now particularly well positioned as we exit the current tech boom and cost\/benefit trade offs matter again."

[1] His basic idea is to separate Twitter into a backend service that hosts content and a front end client that provides moderation and algorithmic curation. Twitter would then open the backend up so that anyone can develop their own client by paying for access.\n\nThe backend would do the minimal amount of moderation necessary to conform with the law in each jurisdiction and then provide optional services to the clients for more sophisticated moderation and algorithmic filtering and ranking. Twitter would continue to host their existing front end and possibly create more over time.\n\nThe idea is that the plethora of clients would allow for experimentation and meeting the diverse user preferences. You could have heavily moderated clients as well as wild west anything goes. While all clients would reference the same social graph and tweets\/replies, each client could use whatever methods they want for filtering and ranking.\n\nSome possible clients I\u2019ve considered.\n\n1. A client geared towards journalists and other prominent people that provides them with a layer that filters out harassment. This could include manual curation of their DMs, replies and retweets. The service would also have a team of lawyers for reporting credible threats of violence to law enforcement and sending cease-and-desist letters for proper libel. (Note this works well with Elon\u2019s plan to require human identity verification, even for anonymous accounts.) This service would be expensive and geared towards people that value this layer of protection for professional reasons.\n\n2. A client geared towards techies like myself that want to experiment with their own algorithms. While we\u2019re a niche group, many of us would gladly pay quite a bit of money to support such a nerdy hobby.

If a public corporation\u2019s quarterly report announced a massive drop in MAUs then they\u2019d be crucified in the market. This would likely also include a large drop in ad revenue since in pretending to be humans many bots will load the full webpage, including ads.\n\nYet as a private company Twitter could better weather the storm. There wouldn\u2019t be public investors dumping the stock or demanding a change in management. While ad revenue would initially decrease, marketers would eventually reevaluate the value of an ad impression with the knowledge that fewer ads are being shown to bots. We\u2019d expect their ad analytics to show higher ROI on ad impressions since fewer are wasted on bots that will never buy a product. Over time, marketers would likely be willing to pay more for each impression and revenue would recover."

From my biased sample of friends and coworkers, there doesn\u2019t seem to be sufficient lifestyle creep to consume their increasingly high financial compensation.\n\nI could see many tech workers' reasons that they\u2019re set for a long retirement if they can just delay withdrawing for another decade to allow for more compounding. Plus, it\u2019s nice to have something to do and many of us enjoy the work (or at least parts of the work).\n\nI\u2019ve known several software engineers in their 40s and 50s that have taken some informal approach to this. The general pattern is to withdraw from management and formal leadership roles and settle into more of an advisory role. That would entail lower compensation, but also lower responsibilities and more focus on mentorship and interesting technical problems. One engineer in particular would take year-long sabbaticals between roles at different companies; with a focus on finding a firm that could benefit from their experience in an advisory role. I\u2019m confident that few of these engineers actually needed the money since they all joined pre-IPO companies that went on to 10x their market cap.\n\nIt would be challenging for a tech firm to provide part time roles in my opinion, particularly because so much time is already spent keeping up to speed on what is going on. Yet I bet there\u2019s a lot of labor cost savings available if a firm can figure it out. I bet there\u2019d be a lot of interest in half-time roles where the tech worker would take far less than half pay. E.g., rather than $400k total comp for a full time role, the half time worker might accept $100k or less."

    "body":"The Federal Open Market Committee\u2014the group that determines monetary policy\u2014does forecast inflation among other economic predictions to guide their policy. That includes estimating future rent contributions to PCE using data such as market rents. For example, here\u2019s the conclusions from a Feb 2022 letter from the SF Fed predicting higher inflation through sustained increases in the rental component due to higher market rents. [1]\n\n> As the U.S. economy recovers from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, some increase in rent inflation should be expected, given that landlords can ask for higher rents when prospective tenants are employed and earning higher incomes. However, the extraordinarily large increases in two leading indicators of future rent inflation\u2014asking rent inflation and house price inflation\u2014point to significant upside risks to the overall inflation outlook. The potential increases are particularly significant for CPI inflation, which places a larger weight on shelter costs. Still, the potential additions to PCE inflation of about 0.5pp for both 2022 and 2023 are important to consider in light of the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% inflation target.\n\nSo the Fed is to some extent considering how current market rents will impact future inflation and using that consideration in developing monetary policy. It could be argued that the FOMC members are not putting sufficient weight on this specific consideration. Additionally, their forecasts may incorrectly estimate the future inflation contribution of rents and misguide policy. For example, in May 2022 the Richmond Fed revisited Aug 2021 predictions about future inflationary contributions of rents made by the Dallas Fed and found the predictions significantly underestimated inflation. [2]\n\n> Growth in the PCE rent index exceeded 4 percent year over year in March, a threshold that the model predicted would not be crossed until the second quarter of 2023. Similarly, imputed rent for homeowners rose 4.4 percent in March, which the model predicted would have been attained in the first quarter of 2023. Year-over-year growth in both rent and imputed rent was over 1.5 percentage points higher than the upper confidence interval of the forecast in March.\n\nIt may simply be that during periods of high economic volatility it is hard to estimate the future trajectory of inflation. Any predictive model developed on historical data may simply fail to extrapolate to the specific novel economic forces that cause the volatility.\n\nIn retrospect it\u2019s easy to say that the Fed should\u2019ve better extrapolated how surging market rents in 2021 would lead to sustained inflation as leases rolled over. But had the sudden surge been followed by a comparable collapse in rents then such predictions would also have looked foolish. The core problem may be the inability to predict the evolution of our economy during periods of high volatility.\n\n[1] \u201cWill Rising Rents Push Up Future Inflation?\u201d, https:\/\/www.frbsf.org\/economic-research\/publications\/economic-letter\/2022\/february\/will-rising-rents-push-up-future-inflation\/\n\n[2] \u201cRevisiting Forecasts for Rent Inflation\u201d, https:\/\/www.richmondfed.org\/research\/national_economy\/macro_minute\/2022\/mm_05_24_22"

    "body":"Great high-level explanation of central banking and theories of how it impacts the economy, including the hydraulic vs. expectations theories. While I agree that the expectation mechanism is the primary way that central banks (CBs) affect economic conditions, I think that only works because there are very real hydraulic mechanisms. QE and short term interest rate targets (via open market operations) very much do influence the financial markets. This includes both short term immediate changes in the cost of capital and long term expectations.\n\nFor example, when a CB institutes QE, they do increase the demand for longer maturity government debt; i.e., treasury notes\/bonds. The increase in demand causes an increase in price, which leads to lower yields (i.e., lower interest rates on government debt).\n\nThis can be illustrated with a contrived and simplified example. Say that before QE, a 1 year T-bill with a face value of $100, and no interest payments (zero coupon bond) was trading at $95. That would give it an effective annual rate of 5%. Say that the QE program includes purchasing such 1 year T-bills and the CB purchases sufficient T-bills such that the increase in demand at constant supply causes them to now trade at $97, reducing the yield to 3%. This QE has a real world impact of reducing the safe yield one could get from a T-bill maturing in one year.\n\nFurther, such changes in the government debt market have spillover effects into other markets. Some investors who would\u2019ve purchased 1 year T-bills will now find that these bonds have insufficient yield for their investment needs. Instead, the investor will move into riskier, yet still relatively safe, high-quality corporate debt; investment grade bonds. Since these bonds are relatively riskier than the risk-free government debt, they always have to offer higher yields. Some investors will be tempted to seek these higher yields and assume greater risk.\n\nAdditionally, investors who already held 1 year T-bills before QE will be tempted to sell them for a nice short term profit. E.g., a T-bill bought yesterday for $95 can be sold today for $97 for an excellent short term profit. Yet the seller now has to find something to do with that cash. They too may seek risker, yet higher yielding, corporate bonds.\n\nAnd the spillover effect continues. The higher demand for investment grade bonds will cause their yields to also fall. Some investors will migrate from investment grade bonds to junk bonds; i.e., riskier bonds from firms with worse credit ratings. Again, there\u2019s spillover, with lower yields across all classes of bonds pushing investors into equities; i.e., stocks. Stocks themselves have various risk levels, and there will be a spillover throughout risk classes. At the end, we get higher demand for the riskiest of investments; e.g., venture capital and speculative assets such as crypto.\n\nAnd again, these real hydraulic impacts influence expectations. Many investors will preemptively shift into riskier assets before an expected loosening of monetary policy influences yields across all classes of investments. The hydraulic and expectation forces also work in reverse with investors rotating into safer assets with a tightening of monetary policies.\n\nI also think that it is noteworthy that the loosening of monetary policy induces a greater demand for riskier financial assets. There\u2019s a lot that we could all discuss around the pros and cons of increased speculation, but I\u2019ll end this long comment without adding my thoughts on that."

    "body":"It\u2019s hard to overstate just how big atheism was in the early internet and how quickly it faded away in the late aughts. Scott Alexander has a long 2019 article about the rise and fall of this movement from his perspective, \u201cNEW ATHEISM: THE GODLESSNESS THAT FAILED\u201d, https:\/\/slatestarcodex.com\/2019\/10\/30\/new-atheism-the-godlessness-that-failed\/\n\nHe recounts how in the 90s and early 2000s the internet was filled with discussion and long essays covering esoteric details of the debate around evolution and religion. Checkout the archive of the usenet group talk.origins for examples, http:\/\/www.talkorigins.org\/\n\nI particularly appreciate how Alexander explains New Atheists as evolving out of these earlier long-form discussions and eassys.\n\n> The atheists of Early Internet Argument Culture were not New Atheists. The term \u201cNew Atheism\u201d didn\u2019t really catch on until about 2006 when Richard Dawkins published The God Delusion; Early Internet Argument Culture was just a prelude to the main event. Post-2006 atheists were brasher and more political. They were less interested in arguing with religious people about the minutiae of carbon-dating; they were more interested in posting about how stupid carbon-dating denalists were, on their own social media feeds, read entirely by other atheists. The concept of the Internet as magical place where you could change other people\u2019s minds had given way to the Internet as magical place where you could complain to like-minded friends about how ignorant other people were.\n\nI\u2019m a little ashamed to admit that I contributed to the barrage of online atheism writing as an edgy atheist teenager circa 2000. I think many of us enjoyed belonging to what felt like a rebellious community with \u201csecret\u201d knowledge of how religion influenced the world. Rather ironically, I imagine this is similar to the experience that draws people to cults. I believe that our long-form writing served as a religious rite that helped us feel closer to the atheist community and more deeply committed to the beliefs."

    "body":"The concept of sentience itself is challenging without even focusing on AI systems. Consider the debate around animal rights and their welfare, which hinges on the subjective experience of these creatures in different conditions. While animals cannot communicate their experience using human language, we can observe that certain actions cause great distress and pain. We can even explain some of the neural and hormonal processes associated with those experiences and show they are highly similar to that which occurs in human biology. That leads us to care about animal treatment and no similar biological analogy exists for AI systems.\n\nSentience is also a consideration in human concerns like the abortion rights debate and end-of-life care. Ezra explored some of these challenges in a recent podcast episode with law professor Kate Greasley, who has extensively studied and written on the legal and moral philosophy of abortion. [1] I found their discussion deeply interesting as they explored the question of what makes something human. A common theme was that in philosophical terms personhood may be something of a continuum, but for practical and legal reasons we need hard dividing lines.\n\n[1] https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/05\/31\/opinion\/ezra-klein-podcast-erika-bachiochi.html"

E.g., create an argument in support of Trump\u2019s attempt to steal the election for Warren voters from a financial regulation and climate change perspective.\n\nObviously such a ridiculous example would just serve as a creative writing prompt for a human writer. And the results would likely be humorous at best and most certainly not convincing to the intended audience. But an AI system could have a much deeper understanding of the written arguments that are convincing to the target group and how the concepts of those arguments could connect to the target prompt. The AI system could develop an understanding of the audience\u2019s psychology that exceeds any human researcher\u2019s ability and discover subtle writing tricks that tap into the target\u2019s subconscious response to text.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t guarantee that AI could actually convince Warren voters to support Trump\u2019s insurrection. But it could likely do far better than any human writer could hope to do. And many other audiences might be more easily convinced with writing engineered to tap deeply into their psyche.\n\nImagine the impact of political messaging teams armed with such an AI system that could engineer the most electorally-efficient platform for their candidate and personalize it down to the individual level based upon each reader\u2019s social media consumption. Individuals could even converse directly with the AI to learn more about the candidate\u2019s platform and in the process be efficiently converted to true believers.\n\n*Edit: Fixed mistake of \"electrically\" instead of \"electorally\""

Such a basic statistics course could be valuable to students understanding how to interpret statistics in the news and other parts of life. Yet I wouldn\u2019t want to see that course take the place of algebra and thereby delay the students' mathematical development.\n\nInstead, maybe the course could be taught alongside algebra and be less focused on the math underlying statistics but more focused on practical applications of stats. I could imagine a valuable course that focuses on stats and financial literacy taught somewhere around 8th grade. Lessons would include actual stats reported in the news and the class would work through how to interpret them. There could even be examples of misleading news stories that misuse states.\n\nYet I do believe any student interested in a mathematical understanding of statistics will need to first take calculus before beginning a \u201cproper\u201d stats course. It\u2019s just that so much of stats involves integration; i.e., area under the curve. Further, I don\u2019t think one can fully appreciate a lot of important math concepts, including p-values and statistical significance, until they have some background in calculus. Such a proper stats course could be deferred until college or possibly taught in senior year of high school to advanced students."

How are  kids like their parents? But half of the genetic variability is within families. Right. Genetics is also about difference and the way that differences play out.

A key point that Kathryn Paige Harden discusses and develops in her book is that variation among people is a good thing, but our social systems can unfairly reward and punish people for variations that may have at least a partial genetic component. One of her chief motivations for writing the book is to highlight the inequities of our current institutions with regard to people\u2019s innate differences.\n\nAnd these innate differences aren\u2019t deterministically genetic. Due to random genetic shuffling, the genetic siblings of a single couple can still vary considerably. One child may receive a particularly favorable set of genetic gifts\u2014favorable within our current institutions and social\/economic structures\u2014while their sibling may receive fewer.

E.g., the rise of far right wing parties throughout Europe in the last decade. And with PR, parties are incentivized to focus on single issues (e.g., opposing immigration) and make that a condition of them joining a governing coalition. This can result in odd governments that few voters would select. E.g., when a right party and left party form a government, excluding the moderate party, such as Greece in 2015.\n\nHere\u2019s an excellent lecture from Ian Shapiro that covers this topic, \u201c Democratic Competition: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\u201d, https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=py-e9-NvFn0"

Southern Democrats engaged in widespread electoral fraud, particularly disenfranchising Black Republicans. And southern Republican electoral officials\u2014officials who oversaw these southern state elections as part of reconstruction\u2014attempted to correct the situation by rejecting fraudulent votes. Even with those corrections that changed state-level results in several southern states the Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes only won nationally by a single electoral vote.\n\nThe conflict was resolved through the Compromise of 1877, which included an informal agreement to end reconstruction. Some excerpts from Wikipedia [1]\n\n> It was one of the most contentious presidential elections in American history. Its resolution involved negotiations between the Republicans and Democrats, resulting in the Compromise of 1877, and on March 2, 1877 the counting of electoral votes by the House and Senate occurred, confirming Hayes as President.\n\n> The results of the election remain among the most disputed ever. Although it is not disputed that Tilden outpolled Hayes in the popular vote, there were wide allegations of electoral fraud, election violence, and other disfranchisement of predominately-Republican Black voters.\n\n> An informal, \"back-room\" deal was struck to resolve the votes: the Compromise of 1877. In the deal, the Democrats conceded the 20 contested electoral votes to Hayes, resulting in a 185-184 victory; in return, the Republicans agreed to withdraw federal troops from the South, marking the end of Reconstruction.\n\n[1] https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/1876_United_States_presidential_election"

We should raise the salience of their most extreme and counterproductive messaging. We should force the anti-abortion side to fight within their coalition, with their supporters of more moderate restrictions having to defend cases where they believe abortion should be allowed. E.g., in cases where both the mother\u2019s life is at risk and the fetus is non-viable. There are anti-abortion extremists that would fight to criminalize that life-saving medical procedure and we should encourage that online fight within our opponent\u2019s coalition."

Instead, SM should be used to promote our best ideas and our opponent\u2019s worst ones. When someone in our coalition posts a counterproductive policy or message, we should just ignore it. Any engagement will just enhance the reach of the counterproductive SM post and encourage further suboptimal posting from our interlocutor.\n\nWe obviously can\u2019t prevent people in our coalitions from picking fights on SM with other members of our team over policy and messaging disagreements.

Instead, articles, podcasts, and other longer form mediums can be used to compare and contrast different approaches as that longer form allows for exploration of nuances as well as gives us the space to demonstrate respect to our compatriots ideas that we simply disagree with.\n\nRather than using 280 characters to provide a sharp criticism of our compatriots, we can write paragraphs in which we empathize with their views, celebrate our common goals, and offer a nuanced comparison of approaches towards our shared goals.  And should others choose to bring our disagreement to SM, possibly even referencing our longer form argument, we can simply choose not to engage.

Matt Klein has a great (paywalled) article covering this mechanism, https:\/\/theovershoot.co\/p\/is-the-2022h1-gdp-declinefake\n\nIn contrast, hypothesis #4, overestimation of aggregate wages, would imply a weaker labor market and that GDI is being overestimated.

According to the National Rental Home Council, a single-family home rental lobbying group, \u201csingle-family rental home companies accounted for less than 0.14 percent of homes purchased\u201d and just 0.09 percent of net homes if you count the fact that many single-family rental investors sold homes as well.\n\n> The role of institutional investors is still being studied, but the popularity of the narrative strikes at something dangerous: People want a convenient boogeyman and when they get it, they often ignore the structural problems that are harder to combat. Housing undersupply is the result of decades of locals opposing new home building. It\u2019s not something that can be blamed on Wall Street greed and the nefarious tinkering of a private equity firm. And that\u2019s a much harder truth to stomach.\n\nAnd there's also the Derek Thompson's Jun 2021 article, \"BlackRock Is Not Ruining the U.S. Housing Market\", https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2021\/06\/blackrock-ruining-us-housing-market\/619224\/\n\n> The U.S. has roughly 140 million housing units, a broad category that includes mansions, tiny townhouses, and apartments of all sizes. Of those 140 million units, about 80 million are stand-alone single-family homes. Of those 80 million, about 15 million are rental properties. Of those 15 million single-family rentals, institutional investors own about 300,000; most of the rest are owned by individual landlords. Of that 300,000, the real-estate rental company Invitation Homes\u2014in which BlackRock is an investor\u2014owns about 80,000.

But before that he was revered as the founder of the Democratic party and as the first American populist. Jackson appealed to a substantially broader section of our people and his election was seen as symbolizing the expansion of the franchise beyond aristocratic landowning elites.\n\nPersonally, I think he at least deserves a lot of credit for skillfully navigating the 1832 nullification crisis. It was an initial test of whether states had to abide by federal laws (in this case tariffs) or whether they could nullify them. This early north\/south conflict could've fractured our United States and I believe Jackson was uniquely qualified to preserve our union.\n\nHe was able to negotiate a compromise consisting of a reduction of the tariffs while also promising to crush any rebellion against them. Jackson\u2019s credibility as a southerner (or at least a western agrian) helped him sell this deal to the tariff opponents. And I think we can assume that he was also aided by his reputation as a mercurial psychopath who would\u2019ve gladly led an army to execute every government official in a rebellious state.\n\nWithout Jackson, particularly with a John Quincy Adams-esque president, our United States might\u2019ve been nothing more than a short-lived experiment that simply demonstrated the follies of democracy."

Any policy that seeks to decrease the consumption of a significant enough portion of the electorate to affect inflation is going to be politically toxic. Just look at how we can\u2019t even contemplate increasing taxes on anyone earning less than $400k\/year.\n\nI don\u2019t think it matters what combination of tax increases and benefit decreases compose such an austerity policy. The simple fact that a non-trivial number of voters will see a proposal to decrease their spending power will lead to massive political blowback. I just don\u2019t see how any politician could propose or support such a proposal without consigning themselves to future electoral defeat.\n\nAlthough I do see some potential if there is some sort of external force constraining our options. For example, the new UK government has been forced into a U-turn when their hastily developed tax cuts and financial support for household energy bills led to turmoil in their government bond market as well as a rapid depreciation of their currency.\n\nI guess something similar could happen in the US. My understanding is that a lot of the 90s concern about deficit was focused on \u201cbond vigilantes\u201d causing financial turmoil if investors lost faith in US government debt. E.g., Carville\u2019s famous quote about wanting to be reincarnated as the bond market because, \u201cYou can intimidate everybody\u201d."

    "body":"> spot rent inflation is higher than average rent inflation, but spot rents are slowing while average rents are accelerating. Right now this doesn\u2019t really matter for policy, but it could in a few months if those trends continue.\n\nAs I detailed in a previous comment on that June article, [1] the Fed is quite aware of the lag between market rents and CPI rent, and they use market rents in their inflation forecasts that guide their monetary policy. Hence, I think they\u2019re unlikely to make a policy mistake based upon being overly focused on backward-looking indicators like CPI rent. They articulate this point with their regular invocation of the phrase, \u201cmonetary policy works with a long and variable lag.\u201d\n\nInstead, I think the biggest challenge that the Fed faces will be inflation volatility on the path back to target. There will be months where inflation appears trending downwards, for example July and Aug in which headline CPI were relatively low due to massive falls in gasoline prices. And it will be tempting to say that the job is done. Particularly, the Fed will be pressured by market participants, politicians, and pundits to end their hawkish policy when volatility gives us short periods of time in which inflation appears vanquished.\n\nYet I think Fed officials are aware of this challenge and tackling it head on. Powell well articulated this in his short Aug 26th speech at Jackson Hole. [2]\n\n> That brings me to the third lesson, which is that we must keep at it until the job is done. History shows that the employment costs of bringing down inflation are likely to increase with delay, as high inflation becomes more entrenched in wage and price setting. The successful Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s followed multiple failed attempts to lower inflation over the previous 15 years. A lengthy period of very restrictive monetary policy was ultimately needed to stem the high inflation and start the process of getting inflation down to the low and stable levels that were the norm until the spring of last year. Our aim is to avoid that outcome by acting with resolve now.\n\n[1] https:\/\/www.slowboring.com\/p\/housing-inflation-is-higher-than\/comment\/7303402\n\n[2] https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/newsevents\/speech\/powell20220826a.htm"

While I\u2019m excited about the green transition and hate the thought of any pro-fossil fuel policy, we have to admit that this will be a transition and any rapid increase in the price of energy (particularly gasoline) will lead to a voter revolt. Hence we need a broad domestic energy policy towards the aim of economic stability and national security that includes stable fossil fuel prices.\n\nOne idea I\u2019ve seen thrown around is having the government make loans to oil and gas firms for increasing production and processing capacity. Firms and their investors are currently skittish about aggressive investments due to the shale boom and bust of the mid 2010s. To protect them against collapsing fossil fuel prices the loans will include novel repayment credits. For example, any barrel of oil sold below $x will generate a credit equal to the difference between $x and the price, where x is something like $60\/barrel. Therefore if fossil fuel prices collapse due to our massive investment then this will be a direct subsidy. Whereas if prices stay high then the government gets the loans paid back in full.\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t like the idea of promoting fossil fuel production. Yet I recognize that we Democrats need a holistic energy policy that includes stable gasoline prices if we want to shepherd the US through the green transition. Otherwise voters will elect another oil man like GWB who may attempt to make the US into another petrostate."

And hence deBoer doesn\u2019t believe education is an effective way to address socioeconomic disparities since relative performance is what matters in the labor market.\n\nThink he\u2019s most recently summarized his thesis in \u201cEducation Doesn't Work 2.0\u201d, https:\/\/freddiedeboer.substack.com\/p\/education-doesnt-work-20\n\n> The brute reality is that most kids slot themselves into academic ability bands early in life and stay there throughout schooling. We have a certain natural level of performance, gravitate towards it early on, and are likely to remain in that band relative to peers until our education ends. There is some room for wiggle, and in large populations there are always outliers. But in thousands of years of education humanity has discovered no replicable and reliable means of taking kids from one educational percentile and raising them up into another. Mobility of individual students in quantitative academic metrics relative to their peers over time is far lower than popularly believed. The children identified as the smart kids early in elementary school will, with surprising regularity, maintain that position throughout schooling. Do some kids transcend (or fall from) their early positions? Sure. But the system as a whole is quite static. Most everybody stays in about the same place relative to peers over academic careers. The consequences of this are immense, as it is this relative position, not learning itself, which is rewarded economically and socially in our society."

As a result, we can\u2019t describe much of the physics relevant for Org in terms of simple principles that build on an understanding of QM, and QM itself is highly non intuitive. Instead, we get a plethora of rules that roughly describe the physics relevant for Org, but each rule has exceptions and the rules interact in unexpected ways. Students basically need to memorize the rules and apply them through route exercerizes to develop something of an intuition.\n\nIn contrast, biology accepts squishy narratives since hard rules fail. We can develop a simple story about the role of something like the mitochondria. We then expand that narrative with greater nuance and understanding as we focus on biological subcomponents, variation across species, impact of disease, and other factors. Each narrative is fractal in structure with subnaratives that add complexity. Eventually we run into specific biochemical processes that include chemical interactions and reactions where the rules of Org begin to provide some structure. \n\nOrg has to live in this layer of rough, non-intuitive, approximate rules and squishy biological narratives."

Probably also needed at least one talk presentation (or at least poster presentation) at a regional meeting.\n\nYeah, you still needed some minimal GPA and GRE scores, but that was rarely the hurdle. Further, if your undergrad research advisor introduced you to a potential grad advisor, and the future advisor wanted you, then nothing else really mattered. Doubly so if your future grad advisor had funding for you. Exceptions could be made for anything. Such referrals were common and I even heard of professors competing for promising undergrads."

    "body":"I agree that higher taxes on the rich will help us tame inflation, but I believe it operates through a relatively slow mechanism similar to increasing interest rates. The rich already spend a disproportionately small portion of their income on consumption; the majority of their income is saved and invested. Increasing taxes may have some impact on their marginal consumption, but they could also just slightly decrease their savings rate. And if we continue to define rich as income in excess of $400k then we are only addressing a vanishingly small amount of consumption.\n\nDecreasing the savings and investment rate of the rich will aid in slowly decreasing inflation. With less investment in the economy fewer new businesses will be created and thereby fewer new jobs. Similarly, existing businesses will be less able to raise capital to expand operations. Distressed businesses will find themselves unable to restructure their debt with new financing and will instead need to minimize their operations or possibly go out of business. All of this will slow the growth of the economy and loosen up the labor market. Note these mechanisms are the same ones impacted by raising interest rates and increasing the cost of capital."

Further, programs would be incentivized to weed out weak students that will likely be poorly served by the program since failure to graduate or failure to find gainful employment post graduation will negatively impact the programs expected financial benefit going forward.\n\nI also like the idea of ensuring someone has some real skin in the game when determining the financial cost\/benefit estimation. That could be the school\u2019s themselves being at least partially responsible for defaulting students. Or the loans could be at least partially funded through private sources, with that debit subject to standard bankruptcy law."

Far more people go to college nowadays and fully subsidizing that rate of attendance would be far more financially burdensome to our taxpayers.\n\nWe need to strike some balance that optimizes the costs and benefits of higher education. That includes the costs and benefits to both society and the individual receiving this education. That can include limiting publicly funded education to a smaller portion of our population; possibly the portion that we believe will provide the most benefits to society with their education.\n\nOr we can internalize some of the costs to students since they also internalize a large amount of the benefits due to their higher lifetime earnings."

And this is a major issue with a certain Democratic voting block.\n\nPersonally, I think the best case for Biden would be for someone to find standing to sue to block this EO on the grounds that it exceeds the president's authority. E.g., something about Congress holding the power of the purse and they cannot delegate such large and open ended financial decisions to the Executive.\n\nIn that case Biden gets to be seen as being in favor of student loan forgiveness without having to suffer the consequences of doing so.

I\u2019ve heard him get a lot of generic criticism, but rarely anything too specific.\n\nIn the rare cases where there is specific criticism, I find it flawed or based on misunderstandings. For example, Summers is commonly blamed for not pushing for more stimulus in the fallout of the Great Recession. Yet I think this was just Summers getting on board with the administration\u2019s agenda. Obama and his top advisors wanted to go big on healthcare and didn\u2019t think they had the political capital to also do a larger stimulus program. They felt they could do one or the other, but not both, and decided to go big on healthcare.\n\nI will concede that Summers can at times come off as an overconfident arrogant asshole.

If so, that legislation had little if any impact on the financial crisis. The separation of commercial and investment banks via GS was irrelevant since all of the problematic financial firms were pure investment banks. E.g., Lehman, Bear Stearns, and Merrill Lynch.\n\nIn fact a key part of containing the fallout was having the struggling investment banks be acquired at fire sale prices by commercial banks. E.g., Bear Stearns by JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch by Bank of America. The failed attempt to facilitate an acquisition of Lehman by Barclays led it to fail and is commonly cited as the trigger of the financial crisis.\n\nI\u2019d recommend the 2010 article, \u201cThe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999: A Bridge Too Far? Or Not Far Enough?\u201d [1] to learn more about the impact of GLB and the financial crisis.\n\n> This Article argues that critics are mistaken in attributing a connection between the GLBA and the financial crisis. In fact, the GLBA had very little, if anything, to do with the financial crisis. Virtually all of the actions that can properly be identified as causes of the crisis could have occurred, and probably would have occurred, even if the GLBA had never been enacted--indeed, even if the original Glass-Steagall barriers had remained wholly intact. Thus, a revival of the Glass-Steagall Act would achieve little, if anything, toward forestalling the kinds of actions that created the crisis or that might create a similar crisis in the future. \n\n[1] https:\/\/web-docs.stern.nyu.edu\/old_web\/economics\/docs\/workingpapers\/2010\/White_The%20Gramm-Leach-Bliley%20Act%20of%201999.pdf"

    "body":"In any discussion of our current investment tax code, I think it is important to understand qualified dividends; dividend income that is taxed at capital gains rates. I get the impression that many people are not familiar with this concept and it's particularly relevant around the discussion of corporate stock buybacks vs dividends to return capital to investors.\n\nLike all things tax related there is some nuance to what counts as qualified dividend, but the gist is:\n1. Hold the stock for sufficiently long (90 days) around the dividend date \n2. Is a US corp or an eligible foreign corp\n\nMeeting these requirements are pretty simple for US investors that primarily invest domestically. You can read more about the requirements at https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/q\/qualifieddividend.asp\n\nIn return for investing domestically and being a long term investor, you pay substantially lower taxes. At most you pay 20% and there are brackets taxed at lower rates. E.g., a single person pays nothing on the first $38k of qualified dividends and 15% up to $425k."

E.g., having to submit a government id to any porn site. Further, I think this is just one instance of a general concern parents have about how their children use the internet, particularly social media.\n\nInstead, I think we should empower parents to better regulate their children's internet usage; or in general better regulate digital screen usage. I imagine something like subsidizing locked-down devices for use by children. These devices would include extremely restrictive default permissions that block installing almost all apps as well as restrict the websites that can be visited by the device to a vanishingly small list. And of course there\u2019d be restrictions on phone\/SMS to only allow approved numbers.\n\nIt would also have time limits that prevent the child from using the device at common sleeping hours as well as limit the maximum time at which the device can be used continuously. E.g., you can only use it from 9 AM to 8 PM and you cannot use it for more than 30 minutes at a time without taking at least a 1 hour break.\n\nParents could then rollback restrictions as they see fit and keep rolling them back as the child ages. That would include allowing certain apps and websites at the parent\u2019s discretion. E.g., you might not let your child use Twitter until they turn 30. App makers could offer child-specific versions that give app-specific controls that the parent can use to regulate usage of individual apps. E.g., a Twitter-for-children that requires the parent to approve each account follow and only shows content from followed accounts. There could also be the option to prevent posting or require each post to be approved by the parent before it becomes visible.\n\nThere may be some temptation for parents to be the \u201ccool parent\u201d that gives their child zero restrictions. But hopefully parents can use peer pressure on each other to enforce some common regulatory regime. And I think there is some value in letting groups of parents figure out the appropriate restrictions for their children in a highly localized manor."

    "body":"While I\u2019m not opposed to capping credit card interest rates (as well capping all unsecured loans, including payday loans), we should recognize how it will impact consumers. The main effect will be withdrawing credit products from the riskiest borrowers. E.g., young people without any credit history, people who\u2019ve defaulted on payments and have lower credit scores, etc. \n\nThat may be a good thing as these consumers can just switch to using debit products to (re)build their credit history. I also think there is an argument that consumers who can only borrow at exorbitant rates should be denied credit rather than taking on the burdensome interest payments. But we should be explicit about this being our desired goal rather than pretending that no one will be denied credit and will instead just get to pay less in interest.\n\nAlso, if we\u2019re going to be revising credit card regulation, then I think we should also look into capping interchange rates. These are the costs charged by the issuing bank to the merchant and can commonly be as high as 2% of the transaction total. These fees are passed on to the consumer by being baked into the purchase prices of all goods and services. Further, card networks prevent merchants from charging different prices for credit cards vs. debit cards or cash. And therefore all consumers subsidize credit card usage. The EU has such a cap at 0.3%. [1]\n\nOf course this is how credit cards are able to offer such generous rewards programs and lure in consumers. But it seems ridiculous for all of us to pay higher purchase prices just so that credit card users can get a portion back in the form of rewards. It would be better all around to just have lower purchase prices and ditch the reward programs.\n\nDebit card rates are already capped by the 2010 Durbin amendment, but it has a loophole for small issuing banks; banks with less than $10 billion in assets are not subjected to this limitation. [2] And this loophole has been exploited, particularly by all of the fintech start ups. [3] \n\n> Think of a fintech company with a debit card. Square\u2019s Cash App. Chime. Robinhood. Stripe Issuing, and users like Ramp and Bench. All of them, virtually without exemption, are brought to you courtesy of a small financial institution that you are unlikely to have heard of (unless you work in fintech or read Terms and Conditions for fun). Durbin exempt interchange is the revenue model which got a thousand pitch decks funded, because it is free to the ultimate consumer and protected by a moat guaranteed (for the moment) by Uncle Sam, contingent on the consumer choosing to use your app\u2019s card.\n\nDisclaimer: I work in fintech at a firm that could benefit from interchange caps and currently leverages the Durbin exemption. These are my personal thoughts and I\u2019m not speaking on behalf of my employer.\n\n[1] https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/lt\/IP_15_4585\n\n[2] https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Durbin_amendment\n\n[3] https:\/\/bam.kalzumeus.com\/archive\/community-banking-and-fintech\/"

It\u2019s obscene that we continue to enable these predatory programs by sadling their students with unserviceable levels of debt through federally-subsidized student loans.\n\nI understand our coalition concerns about aggrieving higher education professionals, but I don\u2019t think we can continue to ignore this problem. We need to work with them to reform their programs so that they are economically sound. We\u2019d need to do this even if we replaced student loans with direct subsidies so as to not squander taxpayer funds.\n\nI\u2019ve seen several analyses over the years about the extent to which the gainful employment test would exclude financially-exploitative non-profit programs. A quick search for up-to-date stats turned up this 2020 article, \u201cMany Nonprofit College Programs Would Fail Gainful Test\u201d. [1]\n\n> Only about 60 percent of programs at private nonprofit institutions, and 70 percent of those at public colleges and universities, would pass the Obama administration\u2019s gainful-employment test, if it were in place and applied to them, according to an online tool developed by a conservative Texas policy group.\n\n> Only 5,646 of 10,147, or 55.6 percent, of private, for-profit programs for which income and debt data were available would have passed the standard. Another 2,071, or a fifth, would have failed. And 2,430, or 24 percent, of the programs would have been on probation.\n\n> But private nonprofits didn\u2019t do much better. Only 6,262 of 10,585 programs, or 59 percent, would have passed. Another 1,916, or 18 percent, would have failed. And 2,407, or 22.7 percent, would have been on probation.\n\n> This indicates that a lot of the people asserting that for-profits are uniquely bad actors are wrong -- as a group, their performance is quite similar to that of nonprofits. Publics do noticeably better than either nonprofit private or for-profit colleges, no doubt because they generally cost less to attend and therefore their graduates have less debt.\n\n[1] https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/news\/2020\/01\/16\/profit-programs-not-only-ones-would-fail-gainful-employment-test"

If so, how? \n\nFor example, KPH\u2019s book seems to challenge our traditional liberal view that expanding education can be used to empower individuals to enter more rewarding career paths and thereby ameliorate poverty. Yet, if there are significant innate genetic components impacting career success in our advanced economy then some people will be inherently disadvantaged in following this path. Further, education and other interventions may not be able to close this gap. In that case we may want to downplay educational expansion as a means to addressing poverty and instead propose more redistribution to directly improve people\u2019s material conditions.\n\nAdditionally, do you think KPH\u2019s strong moral argument for society\/government to ensure everyone lives a life of dignity without material deprivation due the inherent unfairness of the genetic lottery is productive? I can see how many of us liberals\/progressives can easily accept the argument, yet I fear conservatives might use the same scientific facts to argue for a revitalisation of social darwinism.

While I\u2019m certain poor strategy and tactics towards addressing diversity and representation goals is a source of issues, I get the impression that there are additional sources. E.g., the coalition-brain problem in which every left-leaning organization feels compelled to incorporate all other liberal\/progressive causes into its mission, which can give rise to that ACLU tweet in which pro-choice activism needs to incporporate LGBT+ advocacy.\n\nIn thinking through a more general understanding of the challenges of these institutions, I immediately recalled FrigidWind\u2019s comment from Friday\u2019s mailbox that also addressed these issues. [1]\n\n> I think that Matt is either blind or papering over an important part in what makes leftist organizations so vulnerable to the phenomenon described in the Grim article: the types of people who work there. They tend to be low conscientiousness (remember how they said the best way to honor George Floyd was to...loosen deadlines?), high neuroticism and high openness (which is why they follow dumb fads). This is what I call \"protest disorder\" or the \"protestor personality\". Building an organization out of these types is like trying to build using jello bricks. This is why I keep saying that the best organizations are the ones that attract normies.\n\nThere is some harsh truth in that statement which has captivated my thinking on the issues plaguing progressive activists institutes. And that explanation seems to address some of the common themes of the Ryan Grim article; just numerous cases where the mission of an activist group was derailed by counterproductive and divisive diversions.\n\nIn any other organization, I would expect coworkers to pull the focus back to the work at hand. If necessary, I\u2019d expect managers to intervene to explicitly tell someone to get back on task. Yet that may not be possible when a team is disproportionately composed of people with personality traits that make them susceptible to these diversions. Coworkers would not be nudging each other back on task but instead fanning the flames of obstruction.

[1] This will hopefully lead to a continuous boom in productivity and further enrich our populace with extremely low cost goods and services.\n\n> Labor shortages and rising wages are pushing U.S. business to invest in automation. A recent Federal Reserve survey of chief financial officers found that at firms with difficulty hiring, one-third are implementing or exploring automation to replace workers.

[2] \n\n>  Eli Whitney\u2019s cotton gin had created the Cotton South, but the Rust picker threatened to destroy it. \n\nThis invention accelerated the northern migration of black laborers to industrial jobs and out of the extreme poverty of substance sharecropping. Whereas previously the white establishment had implemented brutal measures to fight black migration and thereby maintain their exploited labor supply, the mechanization of cotton picking changed the incentives. In some cases, the local white establishment reversed their position and started to encourage black migration north due to their racist hatred.\n\nYou can read more about the social impact of this technological revolution in David Halberstam\u2019s,  \u201cThe Fifties\u201d.

And we should prefer domestic fossil fuel extraction and refining satisfies a substantial share of the global demand because we can minimize their environmental harm beyond carbon emissions through stringent regulation that is not practiced in other countries.\n\nWhile vilifying oil and gas companies may please certain climate activists, this is a counterproductive approach towards achieving the green transition and further it alienates voters who are being financially squeezed by high and volatile energy prices. We instead need some sort of holistic energy plan that combines policies for accelerating the green transition with healthy respect for a robust domestic oil and gas industry that is necessary throughout this transition."

Putting aside my revulsion to that narrative, I don\u2019t see how taxing and then subsidizing these villainous fossil fuel companies promotes this message. Afterall, why are we giving them back their money if they are the bad guys in this story? And an extra tax sounds like a pretty weak penalty for the crooks that are robbing the American consumer through outrageous gasoline prices. I just don\u2019t think this will resonate with voters.\n\nIf we really wanna go with the greedflation narrative then we should properly commit to it. We should annonce an FTC investigation into collusion between oil and gas producers to curtail supply and therefore control prices. We should say that the general lack of investment into these highly lucrative industries is circumstantial evidence of illegal behavior and warrants a proper federal investigation. We could easily find at least one large investor that is a shareholder in two or more oil companies and suggest that they are illegally coordinating action between independent firms."

The current deflective approaches (e.g., transitory or the \u201cPutin price hike\u201d) aren\u2019t working. Inflation is by far the chief concern among voters and we cannot escape the issue. By instead owning the issue he\u2019ll capture voter attention and demonstrate leadership to addressing American voters\u2019 biggest issue. For example, what if Biden said the following:\n\n> Today I admit that I failed to address inflation issues and as a result Americans are being financially squeezed by higher and higher prices. I was too quick to accept the narrative that these price increases were transitory and would soon abate. That was a comforting narrative that allowed us to avoid addressing the issue head on while we continued to focus on defeating Covid. I now recognize that inflation is not going away on its own and I will make it my top priority to do everything within my power to stabilize prices for all Americans.\n\n> Further, I didn\u2019t properly fortify the US economy against global disruptions. In hindsight it is all too obvious that Putin's deranged leadership of Russia presented a massive liability to the global market for such essential commodities as oil, natural gas, wheat, and numerous metals. I should\u2019ve made it a priority to grow and strengthen US industry in these areas so that we would be prepared to meet shortfalls should Putin choose to remove Russia from the free world and exit these markets.\n\n> Putin has subsequently made that choice with devastating consequences throughout the world, including painfully higher prices for all Americans. I should\u2019ve properly identified that risk even before entering the Whitehouse and prepared the appropriate domestic industrial policy to grow American productive output in these key industries. I have now directed my team to prepare such policy and it will be a top priority to strengthen our industries so that United States can replace Russia\u2019s output and stabilize prices."

For example, in the early 20th century a hardworking, smart, and ambitious young person from the working class rarely had a path to a college education and a professional career. Instead, they\u2019d be working in some labor job. These individuals would be the natural leaders of organized labor since they could not only well empathize with their fellow workers, they also had the talents and drive necessary to build and lead an organization. Whereas nowadays such a talented and ambitious young person would almost certainly go to college, get multiple competitive internships, and find themselves on the pathway to a corporate management role.\n\nBasically a brain drain between economic classes rather than between countries."

In fact there is only a single brief mention of this issue:\n\n> I intentionally didn\u2019t include a lot of economic policies on this list. \u2026 Inflation, which I realize is a huge problem, poses a different kind of challenge. There is little evidence Democrats know how to address it, and even less that voters trust them on the issue.\n\nGreat! We\u2019re admitting defeat on the number one issue on voter\u2019s minds. We might as well forgo spending time, money, and effort on the midterms and just save all of that for 2024; hoping that inflation is no longer an issue.\n\nAny serious plan for the 2022 midterms needs put inflation front and center. I guess the Biden administration\u2019s inadequate attention and lack of a serious plan for inflation is leading others away from this focus. But we cannot secede this territory to the Republicans. We can\u2019t let Republicans continue to reinforce the false narrative that they offer better economic policy.\n\nWe need to embrace something like Skanda Amarnath\u2019s plan to rapidly expand the supply of key commodities, chiefly energy.

    "body":"While great in theory, I think any attempt to focus Democrats on a narrow range of priorities will mainly just cause more intra-party infighting around this prioritization. Rather than clarify party priorities to voters we\u2019d instead just end up reinforcing the \u201cDems in disarray\u201d narrative.\n\nWe ended up in our grab bag, collision-brain situation because everyone is focused on their own pet issues and will not relent to any common consus. Further, as Yglesias has said numerous times, we all more-or-less agree about the dangers of Republican electoral victories, but many progressive activists reject the idea that moderation is the route to defeating the Republicans at the polls.\n\nAnd I think the key reason for that is that electoral defeats don\u2019t harm the loudest activists. Even victories rarely provide any tangible prize that changes their day-to-day lives. (The exception of course being student loan forgiveness.) In contrast, the civil rights movement for racial justice and subsequent causes such as women\u2019s equality and gay rights were led and staffed by direct stakeholders. Success gave immediate improvements in these individuals' lives and defeat meant the continuation of the unjust status quo or possibly even regression of early progress. Hence there was a strong motivation to make pragmatic and strategic decisions to win and make any incremental progress.\n\nI like to think there's a line of attack against our current counterproductive activists that focuses on their lack of table stakes. Something that paints them as charlatans focused on fame and money by exploiting causes that they\u2019re buffered against due to their privileges of elite education and social connections."

    "body":"In terms of education funding levels and policy reforms to improve quality, I think Freddie deBoer has provided a fair amount of valuable critique over the years. His basic thesis is that out-of-school factors dominate (accepted by Yglesias [1]) and almost no education interventions are found to have long term effects on student performance and life outcomes. \n\nI believe this is best summarized in deBoer\u2019s article \u201cEducation Doesn't Work\u201d, https:\/\/freddiedeboer.substack.com\/p\/education-doesnt-work?s=r\n\n> This point is both totally banal and yet potentially revelatory given our educational policy conversations: mobility of individual students in quantitative academic metrics relative to their peers over time is far lower than popularly believed. Students sort themselves into an ability hierarchy at a very early age and tend to stay in their position in that hierarchy for the remainder of their lives, to a remarkable degree. The children identified as the smart kids early in elementary school will, with surprising regularity, maintain that position throughout schooling.\n\n>  Most everybody stays in about the same place relative to peers over academic careers. The consequences of this are immense, as it is this relative position, not learning itself, which is rewarded with economic gain by our society.\n\n> The persistence of relative academic performance is remarkable. Standardized test scores collected at the age of thirteen are strong predictors of not just future high school and college educational performance but adult outcomes like academic career milestones and economic position, even after adjusting for parental income.\n\nI\u2019ve never been particularly comfortable with this critique and its implications. Yet I think it is important when we put so much focus on K-12 education as a means of improving society, including decreasing social inequalities. deBoer\u2019s critique suggests we should decrease the emphasis on education and focus more on income redistribution.\n\n[1]  https:\/\/www.slowboring.com\/p\/more-good-news-about-dcs-teacher?s=r, \u201cschool performance is dominated by out-of-school factors.\u201d"

Should they be legally constrained to just showing links? What if those links happen to include other Google products? E.g., a search for \u201cfree email provider\u201d including GMail? Even with no self-preferencing intent, GMail could be the top search result for that query due to organic user preference.\n\nSimilarly it\u2019s entirely possible that Yelp isn\u2019t showing high in the search results for a restaurant due to organic user behavior. I personally never trust Yelp reviews after reading about how they extort small businesses with the threat of prominently displaying negative reviews.

The self-preferencing of Google info boxes chould still happen entirely internal to the search company. Yelp and other content aggregators would still have the same grievances about Google using their dominant position to prevent other players from capturing user traffic for numerous types of search queries.\n\nYes, the breakup would prevent Alphabet from innovating in other directions using revenue from search. Yet I doubt these ventures would struggle to find capital in the current market as demonstrated by Tesla (public markets) and SpaceX (private markets). If anything, investors may prefer the separation so that they can concentrate on the specific parts of Alphabet that they are interested in. Those that are bullish on self-driving can go all in on Waymo whereas those interested in data aggregation and search can invest in Google Search. Investor choice may result in the attraction of even more capital to the separate ventures than currently available to the conglomerate as a whole.\n\n[1] https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2010\/02\/24\/yelp-class-action-lawsuit\/"
