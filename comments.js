But in neither case have Americans, either white or black, been willing to accept the means necessary to achieve these ends. This is what underlies the policy dilemmas that I have been trying to describe. The commitment to the preservation of a distinct African American culture and identity and the aversion to compulsory forms of inclusion have clearly worked at cross-purposes with the objectives specified by the integrationist ideal. Unwilling to decide which option to pursue, or more often, deeply divided over which option to pursue, African Americans have been unable to formulate a unified set of demands. Lack of direction from the black community has, in turn, generated near-complete paralysis on the issue among progressive whites. Absent any coherent policy agenda, white Americans have turned increasingly inward, toward extreme forms of confessional self\u2011criticism."

The deficit forecast in 2011 increased to $1.42 trillion, up from the $1.27 estimate in February. For 2012, the deficit estimate rose to $922 billion, up from $828 billion in the previous report. The annual budget shortfall would bottom out in 2017 at $721 billion, or 3.4 percent of GDP, and begin rising again in following years."

Obama would need resources to save G.M. and Chrysler, which were close to bankruptcy, and to address the collapsing housing market, which he was told would be hit with five million foreclosures during his first two years in office. Summers cautioned Obama, who had run as a fiscal conservative and attacked his Republican opponent for wanting to raise taxes, that he was about to preside over an explosion of government spending: \u201cThis could come as a considerable sticker shock to the American public and the American political system, potentially reducing your ability to pass your agenda and undermining economic confidence at a critical time.\u201d"

A Berkeley economist, she was new to government. She believed that she had persuaded Summers to raise the stimulus recommendation above the initial estimate, six hundred billion dollars, to something closer to eight hundred billion dollars, but she was frustrated that she wasn\u2019t allowed to present an even larger option. When she had done so in earlier meetings, the incoming chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, asked her, \u201cWhat are you smoking?\u201d She was warned that her credibility as an adviser would be damaged if she pushed beyond the consensus recommendation."

The paradox usually refers in particular to low mortality among Hispanics in the United States relative to non-Hispanic Whites. According to the Center for Disease Control's 2015 Vital Signs report, Hispanics in the United States had a 24% lower risk of mortality, as well as lower risk for nine of the fifteen leading causes of death as compared to Whites."

At times their best marketing strategy is to sell the argument for increasing prices by strangeling out domestic supply. At other times that argument is less palatable. This is no different from car manufacturers highlighting their fuel efficiency when gasoline prices are high and shifting to marketing other features when consumers aren\u2019t focused on prices of gasoline."

We should compare and contrast their marketing strategies through a capitalistic lens no different than how McKinsey would critique Coke\u2019s branding. We should offer advice on how they can create a better product to sell to their donors and suggest books on corporate marketing."

Say that the QE program includes purchasing such 1 year T-bills and the CB purchases sufficient T-bills such that the increase in demand at constant supply causes them to now trade at $97, reducing the yield to 3%. This QE has a real world impact of reducing the safe yield one could get from a T-bill maturing in one year."

How are my kids different from me, how are my kids different from one another? And so, you know, often when people kind of back up to a very strong you know, \u201cthere is no way that genetics influences something like education or intelligence or personality.\u201d I really am like, have you ever spent time with children before? Like, have you been around them? Because I think if you are around them, particularly if you're around, you know, siblings or cousins, you have this front row seat to see how genetic difference plays out, very early in development.

In the years that followed, fiscal stimulus was ample, war spending kept rising, and the deficit grew. But FOMC members were often divided, and their policy decisions reflected this ambivalence. Furthermore, while Martin saw monetary and fiscal policymakers as obligated to work together to promote price stability and growth, he discovered that dealing with this particular White House and Congress was often a one-way street. And even though the Fed was substantially upgrading its analytic capacity in the 1960s \u2014 hiring more Ph.D. economists, building up its research departments, and adopting forecasting \u2014 it didn't always translate into consistent monetary policymaking."

First, we have Evgeny Gaevoy, the founder and CEO of the crypto market-making firm Wintermute, to explain how he used the FTX platform and how he understood its relationship with SBF's trading firm, Alameda Research. Then we speak with independent researcher James Block, author of the Dirty Bubble Media newsletter, and one of the first observers to blow the whistle on the FTX disaster."

History shows that the employment costs of bringing down inflation are likely to increase with delay, as high inflation becomes more entrenched in wage and price setting. The successful Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s followed multiple failed attempts to lower inflation over the previous 15 years. A lengthy period of very restrictive monetary policy was ultimately needed to stem the high inflation and start the process of getting inflation down to the low and stable levels that were the norm until the spring of last year. Our aim is to avoid that outcome by acting with resolve now."

Firms and their investors are currently skittish about aggressive investments due to the shale boom and bust of the mid 2010s. To protect them against collapsing fossil fuel prices the loans will include novel repayment credits. For example, any barrel of oil sold below $x will generate a credit equal to the difference between $x and the price, where x is something like $60/barrel. Therefore if fossil fuel prices collapse due to our massive investment then this will be a direct subsidy. Whereas if prices stay high then the government gets the loans paid back in full."

We have a certain natural level of performance, gravitate towards it early on, and are likely to remain in that band relative to peers until our education ends. There is some room for wiggle, and in large populations there are always outliers. But in thousands of years of education humanity has discovered no replicable and reliable means of taking kids from one educational percentile and raising them up into another. Mobility of individual students in quantitative academic metrics relative to their peers over time is far lower than popularly believed. The children identified as the smart kids early in elementary school will, with surprising regularity, maintain that position throughout schooling. Do some kids transcend (or fall from) their early positions? Sure. But the system as a whole is quite static. Most everybody stays in about the same place relative to peers over academic careers. The consequences of this are immense, as it is this relative position, not learning itself, which is rewarded economically and socially in our society."

These big corporate developers could even be financing astroturf campaigns that disguise their political stooges as champions of social justice so that they can continue to control the zoning process on behalf of their corporate overlords."

Increasing taxes may have some impact on their marginal consumption, but they could also just slightly decrease their savings rate. And if we continue to define rich as income in excess of $400k then we are only addressing a vanishingly small amount of consumption."

Distressed businesses will find themselves unable to restructure their debt with new financing and will instead need to minimize their operations or possibly go out of business. All of this will slow the growth of the economy and loosen up the labor market. Note these mechanisms are the same ones impacted by raising interest rates and increasing the cost of capital."

Those that are bullish on self-driving can go all in on Waymo whereas those interested in data aggregation and search can invest in Google Search. Investor choice may result in the attraction of even more capital to the separate ventures than currently available to the conglomerate as a whole."
