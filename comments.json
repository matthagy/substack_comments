And if we continue to define rich as income in excess of $400k then we are only addressing a vanishingly small amount of consumption."

Distressed businesses will find themselves unable to restructure their debt with new financing and will instead need to minimize their operations or possibly go out of business. All of this will slow the growth of the economy and loosen up the labor market. Note these mechanisms are the same ones impacted by raising interest rates and increasing the cost of capital."

Instead, they\u2019re primary focus is on fundraising and volunteer recruiting. At times their best marketing strategy is to sell the argument for increasing prices by strangeling out domestic supply. At other times that argument is less palatable. This is no different from car manufacturers highlighting their fuel efficiency when gasoline prices are high and shifting to marketing other features when consumers aren\u2019t focused on prices of gasoline."

We should compare and contrast their marketing strategies through a capitalistic lens no different than how McKinsey would critique Coke\u2019s branding.

A plan that likely involves coercion into treatment and in some cases institutionalization.

[1] Basically, fighting the domestic O&G industry is essentially a \u201cshadow carbon tax\u201d, with the \u201ctax\u201d captured by foreign O&G producers (e.g., Russia and Saudi Arabia). Further, rather than predictably increasing over time\u2014as a carbon tax should so that consumers can plan to transition away\u2014we instead get volatile prices that just financially harm Americans. That anti-domestic O&G industry policy and messaging could even be counterproductive if voters come to associate Democrats as the cause of the high and volatile energy prices."

For example, Yglesias has proposed decreasing the volatility of oil prices by massively expanding the strategic petroleum reserve to soak up domestic oil when it\u2019s cheap (possibly guaranteeing a price floor for the domestic market) and sell it into the market when it gets expensive. [2] Such a shift in messaging and policy should generally encourage private investment in the domestic O&G industry as skittish investors get reassured that their investments will not be regulated out of existence in the near future."

There may be a good justification for why interest should be a pre-tax expense in at least some cases, but the result is that corporate accountants will be failing shareholders if they don't find the optimal level of debt for a given corp's cash flow."

Yet, we readers don\u2019t need to constantly see such comments on almost every article."

Comments from those users would get a boost in ranking.

The paradox usually refers in particular to low mortality among Hispanics in the United States relative to non-Hispanic Whites. According to the Center for Disease Control's 2015 Vital Signs report, Hispanics in the United States had a 24% lower risk of mortality, as well as lower risk for nine of the fifteen leading causes of death as compared to Whites."

We have a certain natural level of performance, gravitate towards it early on, and are likely to remain in that band relative to peers until our education ends. There is some room for wiggle, and in large populations there are always outliers. But in thousands of years of education humanity has discovered no replicable and reliable means of taking kids from one educational percentile and raising them up into another. Mobility of individual students in quantitative academic metrics relative to their peers over time is far lower than popularly believed. The children identified as the smart kids early in elementary school will, with surprising regularity, maintain that position throughout schooling. Do some kids transcend (or fall from) their early positions? Sure. But the system as a whole is quite static. Most everybody stays in about the same place relative to peers over academic careers. The consequences of this are immense, as it is this relative position, not learning itself, which is rewarded economically and socially in our society."

A lengthy period of very restrictive monetary policy was ultimately needed to stem the high inflation and start the process of getting inflation down to the low and stable levels that were the norm until the spring of last year. Our aim is to avoid that outcome by acting with resolve now."

Obama would need resources to save G.M. and Chrysler, which were close to bankruptcy, and to address the collapsing housing market, which he was told would be hit with five million foreclosures during his first two years in office.

A Berkeley economist, she was new to government. She believed that she had persuaded Summers to raise the stimulus recommendation above the initial estimate, six hundred billion dollars, to something closer to eight hundred billion dollars, but she was frustrated that she wasn\u2019t allowed to present an even larger option. When she had done so in earlier meetings, the incoming chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, asked her, \u201cWhat are you smoking?\u201d She was warned that her credibility as an adviser would be damaged if she pushed beyond the consensus recommendation."

But he said that red ink must be stopped as the economy recovers. During a recovery, private investment will again pick up and compete with the federal government for capital.

Furthermore, while Martin saw monetary and fiscal policymakers as obligated to work together to promote price stability and growth, he discovered that dealing with this particular White House and Congress was often a one-way street. And even though the Fed was substantially upgrading its analytic capacity in the 1960s \u2014 hiring more Ph.D. economists, building up its research departments, and adopting forecasting \u2014 it didn't always translate into consistent monetary policymaking."

First, we have Evgeny Gaevoy, the founder and CEO of the crypto market-making firm Wintermute, to explain how he used the FTX platform and how he understood its relationship with SBF's trading firm, Alameda Research. Then we speak with independent researcher James Block, author of the Dirty Bubble Media newsletter, and one of the first observers to blow the whistle on the FTX disaster."

I get that he is trying to push back against the strands of eco-asceticism and pastoralism you see on the left, and I do not subscribe to that worldview, but I can't help but feel there is just something decadent and hollow about American-style consumerism.

This has the effect of increasing the salience of race in everyday interactions. If a multinational solution were feasible, this cultural politics would be useful. Unfortunately, it tends to undermine integrationist goals, since it blocks one of the major strategies used in successful models of polyethnic integration.

But in neither case have Americans, either white or black, been willing to accept the means necessary to achieve these ends. This is what underlies the policy dilemmas that I have been trying to describe. The commitment to the preservation of a distinct African American culture and identity and the aversion to compulsory forms of inclusion have clearly worked at cross-purposes with the objectives specified by the integrationist ideal. Unwilling to decide which option to pursue, or more often, deeply divided over which option to pursue, African Americans have been unable to formulate a unified set of demands. Lack of direction from the black community has, in turn, generated near-complete paralysis on the issue among progressive whites. Absent any coherent policy agenda, white Americans have turned increasingly inward, toward extreme forms of confessional self\u2011criticism."

In practice, you can\u2019t build a robust welfare state with taxes only focused on such a small group of taxpayers. There is a lot of income, financing a lot of private consumption, within the upper middle class, and we\u2019ll need to significantly increase taxes on that income band in order to redirect resources from private consumption into public services. A strong welfare state entails the reallocation of tangible resources (chiefly labor) and our taxes need to be structured accordingly."

Some have suggested that Democrats should focus solely on economic issues, but that ignores the very real interest in civil rights and cultural issues among many Democratic voters. Should some politicians ignore that, others will fill the void. For example, Clinton\u2019s embrace of identity issues in the 2016 primary election to outflank Sanders."

I think the \u201cnew\u201d view tends to be equally fatalistic, just putting the blame on racism \u2014 white supremacist ideology was too deeply ingrained in American civic culture \u2014 and holds up the Radicals as noble (albeit doomed) heroes.

Lincoln swapped Hamlin for Johnson to help secure re-election, but in the end the 1864 election wasn\u2019t very close. The Lincoln-Hamlin ticket maybe wins a bit more narrowly but they still win. And now instead of Lincoln\u2019s assassination bringing to power a white supremacist Democrat, it puts a Radical in office at a time when the military is still publicly mobilized and the population is primed for vengeance. I think a Hamlin-led Reconstruction would have been much harsher from the outset, potentially featuring things like real land reform that could have led to a durable Reconstruction order."

The quality of economic data from this era is not great, but Andrew Jalil\u2019s paper on the history of American banking crises suggests it kicked off a pretty serious recession. Could this have been prevented? I don\u2019t know \u2014 historians seem a little uncertain as to why the panic happened at all. But Grant did veto a controversial piece of legislation in 1874 known as the Inflation Bill and the economy instead experienced deflation. Perhaps if they\u2019d given it a better name like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Grant would have signed it, the economy would have prospered, and the Reconstruction coalition would have stayed in place longer."

The mystery is all the more striking because the repeal was not done in the dead of night, like a congressional pay raise. It came at the end of a multiyear populist campaign launched by a few individuals, and was heralded by its supporters as a signal achievement for Americans who are committed to the work ethic and the American Dream."

I think some of the most interesting sociological questions revolve around whether there are any ways around the practical and moral difficulties with tribalism, what social phenomena are explicable as the struggle of tribes to maintain themselves in the face of pressure, and whether tribalism continues to be a worthwhile or even a possible project at all."

This is a fraction of Facebook, half of Facebook Messenger, fewer than Instagram and not that much bigger than SnapChat; presuming the latter service passes Twitter later this year, Twitter will be only the 5th most popular U.S.-based social networking service looking to monetize through advertising. This distinction \u2014 which excludes WhatsApp, at least for now \u2014 is a critical one, because the issue with advertisers is most don\u2019t have the time or ability to work with multiple services; it\u2019s likely most digital advertising spending (which I believe is set to expand greatly) will be consolidated onto the biggest networks (along with Google\u2019s properties), with Facebook taking the lion\u2019s share.

There is some room for wiggle, and in large populations there are always outliers. But in thousands of years of education humanity has discovered no replicable and reliable means of taking kids from one educational percentile and raising them up into another. Mobility of individual students in quantitative academic metrics relative to their peers over time is far lower than popularly believed. The children identified as the smart kids early in elementary school will, with surprising regularity, maintain that position throughout schooling. Do some kids transcend (or fall from) their early positions? Sure. But the system as a whole is quite static. Most everybody stays in about the same place relative to peers over academic careers. The consequences of this are immense, as it is this relative position, not learning itself, which is rewarded economically and socially in our society."

In 2003\u20132004, Berlin implemented a number of labor reforms\u2014referred to as the Hartz reforms\u2014whose net impact was to weaken the bargaining power of workers and substantially slow wage growth to well below GDP growth. When this happened, Germany\u2019s trade deficit became one of the largest surpluses in history as its unemployment level fell sharply.

Eg, serve on the chamber of commerce, make loans to local businesses, and work with community political organizers.

Soros is concerned about abuses in policing and incarceration, while Thiel is opposed to democracy in general, particularly when it limits his wealth and power.

I believe it counterproductive to put so much blame on individuals, regardless of their wealth and power, because it distracts from understanding and countering their more general political opponents."

The discussions also touch on the implications of decisions made in foreign policy, specifically concerning tensions with Iran and the strategic considerations of state vs. non-state threats. Perspectives on the Democratic Party suggest frustrations with their choices and a need for a broader coalition approach. There is a sense that key political and journalistic failures have led to a contemporary environment of skepticism and division, complicating the integrity of the democratic process and the perception of truth in media reporting."

They argue that this common ownership reduces competition, finding \"that ticket prices are approximately 3-5% higher on the average US airline route than would be the case under separate ownership.\" A possible explanation for this finding is that mutual funds that own lots of shares in all of the airlines don't really push any one airline to cut prices to compete hard against the other airlines: Cutting margins to gain market share might work for one airline, but for the airlines as a group it drives down profits. And airlines' shareholders own airlines as a group, not individually."

This comes up a lot in mergers and acquisitions. Company A wants to buy Company B. If they combine, they will have cost savings worth $X, and the question is how much of $X goes to Company B shareholders in the form of merger premium and how much of it goes to Company A shareholders. If you are a diversified investor holding a proportional amount of both companies' shares, you don't care at all. You just want the deal done. But because corporate law, at least in the M&A context, gives directors a duty to maximize value for their shareholders, Company B will negotiate hard to get as much of the premium as possible. Money will be spent on bankers and lawyers. Company A might be pushed to raise a lot of debt to pay more, making the benefits of the deal riskier (for Company A). And Company B might ultimately just say no to a deal because it doesn't like how the benefits are split, denying those benefits to diversified shareholders. By maximizing value for its shareholders, considered as its shareholders, Company B might actually be hurting those same shareholders, considering their entire portfolios."

Examples from the UK, Israel, and the US indicate a broader failure of officials to navigate the complexities of government leadership. Additionally, observations note that political contenders who stand out on policy issues, such as Barack Obama, are currently lacking, and that the trend toward democratization within party nomination processes has correlated with an increase in less popular nominees. Comparisons are drawn with the UK and other European countries, where the importation of primary systems has led to divisive party leadership selections and a decline in traditional mainstream parties."

Concerns about President Biden's age, thoughts on dropping Vice-President Harris for a more popular running mate, the perceived decline of center-left political power, and the complexity of holding political figures accountable in a system flooded with elections and candidates also weave through the debate. The trade-offs between democratization within party structures and the effectiveness of top-down candidate selection by party elites form a central thread, suggesting that greater internal coordination and control may lead to more competent and palatable political leadership."

We have a certain natural level of performance, gravitate towards it early on, and are likely to remain in that band relative to peers until our education ends. There is some room for wiggle, and in large populations there are always outliers. But in thousands of years of education humanity has discovered no replicable and reliable means of taking kids from one educational percentile and raising them up into another. Mobility of individual students in quantitative academic metrics relative to their peers over time is far lower than popularly believed. The children identified as the smart kids early in elementary school will, with surprising regularity, maintain that position throughout schooling. Do some kids transcend (or fall from) their early positions? Sure. But the system as a whole is quite static. Most everybody stays in about the same place relative to peers over academic careers. The consequences of this are immense, as it is this relative position, not learning itself, which is rewarded economically and socially in our society."

Yet, these stories and predictions can be counterproductive when they prevent people from recognizing and adapting to our present reality.

He suggests that high potential rewards encourage risk-taking necessary for venture funding and founding startups. He emphasizes that attacking inequality by limiting wealth stifles economic growth, advocating instead to address corruption and the links between wealth and power. Graham concludes that societies should focus on transparency to limit power abuses, rather than reducing inequality itself."

Yet the process of structuring specific industries while leaving others to the markets was open at least the appearance of corruption.

The FDR administration even began to recognize this at the time and quietly wound these down cartels after the NRA was struck down by the courts."

Those were routine in remote all hands meetings. Moreover, we also knew the chicken-raising cabin was only an hour or two walk from Twitter and Square offices in SF, and he commonly walked it to give himself more time to think. We hoped he had sufficient security\u2014not because we feared he\u2019d be kidnapped and ransomed\u2014but because he\u2019d likely quickly acclimate to his captors views and soon find himself leading some esoteric terrorist group.

As noted in the aforementioned Stratechery article, US payments processing has been commoditized for decades because there are only three card networks of any significance and no noteworthy state-specific regulations. In contrast, each European country has its own banks, its own payment networks and its own regulations, in addition to EU-level regulations. Hence, Adyen was able to thrive on abstracting away this complexity for multi-country European merchants. Whereas Stripe, similar to Square, took on the regulatory and financial risk of allowing self-serve payments to small merchants and quickly had to add additional value (even just modern APIs and management UIs) to outcompete legacy providers with lower costs."

That fixed cost of $0.30 can quickly add up for low-dollar value transactions and for subscriptions can justify an annual discount on its own. In contrast, Ayden uses \u201cInterchange++ pricing\u201d, [2] where the merchant is exposed to the variable costs of different cards, issued by different banks, which is generally cheaper than the blended cost of Stripe. There are still fixed costs for each payment and moreover the merchant also has to pay the costs associated with refunds and chargebacks. Just at sufficient scale it\u2019s sensible to internalize those costs, including minimizing the risks of refunds and chargebacks by being a trustworthy retailer. Stripe, Adyen, and Square may be passing on some of those costs, but more importantly, they need to drop bad merchants lest the platform fall into conflict with the card networks and card-issuing banks. You certainly don\u2019t wanna mess with Visa or JP Morgan Chase, because, as large, highly-regulated financial institutions, they\u2019ll always be in the right."

Unlike the conventional focus on misinformation spread through social media, elite misinformation shapes public discourse and policy decisions by distorting facts to serve institutional or political goals, often without accountability. Examples include exaggerated maternal mortality statistics, misleading claims about fossil fuel subsidies, and overblown fears about policy changes like net neutrality. The author argues that while these distortions may be well-intentioned, they ultimately undermine credibility, mislead allies more than persuading opponents, and weaken effective policy-making by building arguments on false premises rather than actual solutions."

Notably, Daniel Bell\u2019s 1973 work, The Coming of Post-Industrial Society. While I\u2019ve only read reviews and derivative work, I believe he and other 70s-era Marxists correctly identified how manufacturing and the developed-world economy at large was becoming less manual labor intensive. Moreover, more value was generated, or at least captured, by increasingly differentiated knowledge work such as finance, marketing, R&D, engineering, etc."

Even non-management knowledge workers see their unique differentiation with respect to similar workers as a competitive advantage and are cross-pressured between their shared class interests and competition. For example, I\u2019ve seen numerous attempts to unionize or otherwise organize tech workers such as software engineers collapse because we our shared interests are also largely shared with management and shareholders\u2014whereas there is also conflict between how we should each be rewarded relative to other superficially similar workers."

So all of this going mainstream and increasingly becoming the lens through which most people build their model of reality could totally reverse the social media amplification effect.

Eg, the 2007-08 great financial crisis involved investment banks that were trading in relatively liquid mortgage backed securities, commonly using short term funding from overnight money market funds. Ie, the old school run on a \"commercial deposits and lending\" bank, but on steroids due to the complexity of highly liquid, interlocking markets. Conversely, when Harvard, CalPERS, or Black Rock [1] locks up $2b in a private credit investment, they aren't planning on quick liquidity; and if they sought it out they would expect to take a huge haircut from the sophisticated counterparty that they eventually found."

Sure they could gift it to their children, who would run it to the ground, or sell for cheap to someone on their staff. But if the SMB owner actually wants to retire and provide for their children, then PE might offer them the best terms. Moreover, PE could be incentivized to buy due to the owner largely arbitraging their own time to create consumer and worker surplus. Eg, install professional management, raise prices, tighten up work requirements, and collect above average profit until consumers and the market fully adapts over the course of years."

PE might even give them the option to incrementally buy into the equity ownership. But I don't think we should count on overly charitable owners forever. After all, eventually even that will fail once some finds the Walmart or Amazon approach to competing at scale, possibly using tech advances in automation or just disintermediation a la Uber and Task Rabbit."

For many laypersons, including American Descendants of Slavery (ADos) individuals, this was the easiest concern to laugh at because it sounded like another primary school history lesson revisiting the black-white continuum through hundreds of years of American and Western European history. It only got complex as more racial, ethnic, religious, and philosophical labels were added.

I believe there are even Medicare/Medicaid regulations that provide larger remembrances to proper hospitals rather than simple doctor\u2019s offices as has led to consolidation into such wasteful, rent seeking hospital networks. In contrast, an abundance approach would aggressively look to cut costs by eliminating such loopholes and finding more efficient ways to rationalize costs vs. benefits."

Eg, the demise of Twitter and the failure of BlueSky, Threads, Mastadeon, etc to recapture that global community aspect. Ideally our modern antisocial individuals can increasingly find small, niche communities for diversion. Many may even captivate themselves with artificial companions. Over time that should weaken the strength of antisocial political movements like MAGA and The DSA. Hence, reality can return to those actually living in it."
