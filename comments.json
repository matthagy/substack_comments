Increasing taxes may have some impact on their marginal consumption, but they could also just slightly decrease their savings rate. And if we continue to define rich as income in excess of $400k then we are only addressing a vanishingly small amount of consumption."

With less investment in the economy fewer new businesses will be created and thereby fewer new jobs. Similarly, existing businesses will be less able to raise capital to expand operations. Distressed businesses will find themselves unable to restructure their debt with new financing and will instead need to minimize their operations or possibly go out of business. All of this will slow the growth of the economy and loosen up the labor market. Note these mechanisms are the same ones impacted by raising interest rates and increasing the cost of capital."

Instead, they\u2019re primary focus is on fundraising and volunteer recruiting. At times their best marketing strategy is to sell the argument for increasing prices by strangeling out domestic supply. At other times that argument is less palatable. This is no different from car manufacturers highlighting their fuel efficiency when gasoline prices are high and shifting to marketing other features when consumers aren\u2019t focused on prices of gasoline."

We should compare and contrast their marketing strategies through a capitalistic lens no different than how McKinsey would critique Coke\u2019s branding.

A plan that likely involves coercion into treatment and in some cases institutionalization.

[1] Basically, fighting the domestic O&G industry is essentially a \u201cshadow carbon tax\u201d, with the \u201ctax\u201d captured by foreign O&G producers (e.g., Russia and Saudi Arabia). Further, rather than predictably increasing over time\u2014as a carbon tax should so that consumers can plan to transition away\u2014we instead get volatile prices that just financially harm Americans. That anti-domestic O&G industry policy and messaging could even be counterproductive if voters come to associate Democrats as the cause of the high and volatile energy prices."

For example, Yglesias has proposed decreasing the volatility of oil prices by massively expanding the strategic petroleum reserve to soak up domestic oil when it\u2019s cheap (possibly guaranteeing a price floor for the domestic market) and sell it into the market when it gets expensive. [2] Such a shift in messaging and policy should generally encourage private investment in the domestic O&G industry as skittish investors get reassured that their investments will not be regulated out of existence in the near future."

There may be a good justification for why interest should be a pre-tax expense in at least some cases, but the result is that corporate accountants will be failing shareholders if they don't find the optimal level of debt for a given corp's cash flow."

The paradox usually refers in particular to low mortality among Hispanics in the United States relative to non-Hispanic Whites.

We have a certain natural level of performance, gravitate towards it early on, and are likely to remain in that band relative to peers until our education ends. There is some room for wiggle, and in large populations there are always outliers. But in thousands of years of education humanity has discovered no replicable and reliable means of taking kids from one educational percentile and raising them up into another. Mobility of individual students in quantitative academic metrics relative to their peers over time is far lower than popularly believed. The children identified as the smart kids early in elementary school will, with surprising regularity, maintain that position throughout schooling. Do some kids transcend (or fall from) their early positions? Sure. But the system as a whole is quite static. Most everybody stays in about the same place relative to peers over academic careers. The consequences of this are immense, as it is this relative position, not learning itself, which is rewarded economically and socially in our society."

A lengthy period of very restrictive monetary policy was ultimately needed to stem the high inflation and start the process of getting inflation down to the low and stable levels that were the norm until the spring of last year.

Obama would need resources to save G.M. and Chrysler, which were close to bankruptcy, and to address the collapsing housing market, which he was told would be hit with five million foreclosures during his first two years in office.

When she had done so in earlier meetings, the incoming chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, asked her, \u201cWhat are you smoking?\u201d She was warned that her credibility as an adviser would be damaged if she pushed beyond the consensus recommendation."

But he said that red ink must be stopped as the economy recovers. During a recovery, private investment will again pick up and compete with the federal government for capital.

Furthermore, while Martin saw monetary and fiscal policymakers as obligated to work together to promote price stability and growth, he discovered that dealing with this particular White House and Congress was often a one-way street.

First, we have Evgeny Gaevoy, the founder and CEO of the crypto market-making firm Wintermute, to explain how he used the FTX platform and how he understood its relationship with SBF's trading firm, Alameda Research.

I get that he is trying to push back against the strands of eco-asceticism and pastoralism you see on the left, and I do not subscribe to that worldview, but I can't help but feel there is just something decadent and hollow about American-style consumerism.

This has the effect of increasing the salience of race in everyday interactions. If a multinational solution were feasible, this cultural politics would be useful.

But in neither case have Americans, either white or black, been willing to accept the means necessary to achieve these ends. This is what underlies the policy dilemmas that I have been trying to describe. The commitment to the preservation of a distinct African American culture and identity and the aversion to compulsory forms of inclusion have clearly worked at cross-purposes with the objectives specified by the integrationist ideal. Unwilling to decide which option to pursue, or more often, deeply divided over which option to pursue, African Americans have been unable to formulate a unified set of demands. Lack of direction from the black community has, in turn, generated near-complete paralysis on the issue among progressive whites. Absent any coherent policy agenda, white Americans have turned increasingly inward, toward extreme forms of confessional self\u2011criticism."

There is a lot of income, financing a lot of private consumption, within the upper middle class, and we\u2019ll need to significantly increase taxes on that income band in order to redirect resources from private consumption into public services.

Some have suggested that Democrats should focus solely on economic issues, but that ignores the very real interest in civil rights and cultural issues among many Democratic voters.

I think the \u201cnew\u201d view tends to be equally fatalistic, just putting the blame on racism \u2014 white supremacist ideology was too deeply ingrained in American civic culture \u2014 and holds up the Radicals as noble (albeit doomed) heroes.

Lincoln swapped Hamlin for Johnson to help secure re-election, but in the end the 1864 election wasn\u2019t very close. The Lincoln-Hamlin ticket maybe wins a bit more narrowly but they still win. And now instead of Lincoln\u2019s assassination bringing to power a white supremacist Democrat, it puts a Radical in office at a time when the military is still publicly mobilized and the population is primed for vengeance. I think a Hamlin-led Reconstruction would have been much harsher from the outset, potentially featuring things like real land reform that could have led to a durable Reconstruction order."

The quality of economic data from this era is not great, but Andrew Jalil\u2019s paper on the history of American banking crises suggests it kicked off a pretty serious recession. Could this have been prevented? I don\u2019t know \u2014 historians seem a little uncertain as to why the panic happened at all. But Grant did veto a controversial piece of legislation in 1874 known as the Inflation Bill and the economy instead experienced deflation. Perhaps if they\u2019d given it a better name like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Grant would have signed it, the economy would have prospered, and the Reconstruction coalition would have stayed in place longer."

The mystery is all the more striking because the repeal was not done in the dead of night, like a congressional pay raise.

This is a fraction of Facebook, half of Facebook Messenger, fewer than Instagram and not that much bigger than SnapChat; presuming the latter service passes Twitter later this year, Twitter will be only the 5th most popular U.S.-based social networking service looking to monetize through advertising. This distinction \u2014 which excludes WhatsApp, at least for now \u2014 is a critical one, because the issue with advertisers is most don\u2019t have the time or ability to work with multiple services; it\u2019s likely most digital advertising spending (which I believe is set to expand greatly) will be consolidated onto the biggest networks (along with Google\u2019s properties), with Facebook taking the lion\u2019s share.

But in thousands of years of education humanity has discovered no replicable and reliable means of taking kids from one educational percentile and raising them up into another. Mobility of individual students in quantitative academic metrics relative to their peers over time is far lower than popularly believed. The children identified as the smart kids early in elementary school will, with surprising regularity, maintain that position throughout schooling. Do some kids transcend (or fall from) their early positions? Sure. But the system as a whole is quite static. Most everybody stays in about the same place relative to peers over academic careers. The consequences of this are immense, as it is this relative position, not learning itself, which is rewarded economically and socially in our society."

For over a decade, Germany suffered from high unemployment as its producers were priced out of the market by foreign competitors. In 2003\u20132004, Berlin implemented a number of labor reforms\u2014referred to as the Hartz reforms\u2014whose net impact was to weaken the bargaining power of workers and substantially slow wage growth to well below GDP growth. When this happened, Germany\u2019s trade deficit became one of the largest surpluses in history as its unemployment level fell sharply. In a globalized world, the way to gain competitiveness is to reduce the real value of wages, either by reducing nominal wages (as Germany did), or by undervaluing the currency (as many Asian countries do)."

It also shields these individuals from political blowback since they can always blame the procedures rather than have to own up to a mistake."

Soros is concerned about abuses in policing and incarceration, while Thiel is opposed to democracy in general, particularly when it limits his wealth and power.

I believe it counterproductive to put so much blame on individuals, regardless of their wealth and power, because it distracts from understanding and countering their more general political opponents."

The discussions also touch on the implications of decisions made in foreign policy, specifically concerning tensions with Iran and the strategic considerations of state vs. non-state threats. Perspectives on the Democratic Party suggest frustrations with their choices and a need for a broader coalition approach. There is a sense that key political and journalistic failures have led to a contemporary environment of skepticism and division, complicating the integrity of the democratic process and the perception of truth in media reporting."

They argue that this common ownership reduces competition, finding \"that ticket prices are approximately 3-5% higher on the average US airline route than would be the case under separate ownership.\" A possible explanation for this finding is that mutual funds that own lots of shares in all of the airlines don't really push any one airline to cut prices to compete hard against the other airlines: Cutting margins to gain market share might work for one airline, but for the airlines as a group it drives down profits. And airlines' shareholders own airlines as a group, not individually."

This comes up a lot in mergers and acquisitions. Company A wants to buy Company B. If they combine, they will have cost savings worth $X, and the question is how much of $X goes to Company B shareholders in the form of merger premium and how much of it goes to Company A shareholders. If you are a diversified investor holding a proportional amount of both companies' shares, you don't care at all. You just want the deal done. But because corporate law, at least in the M&A context, gives directors a duty to maximize value for their shareholders, Company B will negotiate hard to get as much of the premium as possible. Money will be spent on bankers and lawyers. Company A might be pushed to raise a lot of debt to pay more, making the benefits of the deal riskier (for Company A). And Company B might ultimately just say no to a deal because it doesn't like how the benefits are split, denying those benefits to diversified shareholders. By maximizing value for its shareholders, considered as its shareholders, Company B might actually be hurting those same shareholders, considering their entire portfolios."

Concerns about President Biden's age, thoughts on dropping Vice-President Harris for a more popular running mate, the perceived decline of center-left political power, and the complexity of holding political figures accountable in a system flooded with elections and candidates also weave through the debate. The trade-offs between democratization within party structures and the effectiveness of top-down candidate selection by party elites form a central thread, suggesting that greater internal coordination and control may lead to more competent and palatable political leadership."

We have a certain natural level of performance, gravitate towards it early on, and are likely to remain in that band relative to peers until our education ends. There is some room for wiggle, and in large populations there are always outliers. But in thousands of years of education humanity has discovered no replicable and reliable means of taking kids from one educational percentile and raising them up into another. Mobility of individual students in quantitative academic metrics relative to their peers over time is far lower than popularly believed. The children identified as the smart kids early in elementary school will, with surprising regularity, maintain that position throughout schooling. Do some kids transcend (or fall from) their early positions? Sure. But the system as a whole is quite static. Most everybody stays in about the same place relative to peers over academic careers. The consequences of this are immense, as it is this relative position, not learning itself, which is rewarded economically and socially in our society."

And I recall reading about how the founders explicitly sought a relatively strong executive following the state-level failures of weak executives created during the Revolutionary War era.

Yet those governments were pathologically ineffective, which created their own problems. Striking a balance between effectiveness and accountability is quite hard."

At most, we can offer everyone an opportunity to keep working on improving their ranking in a generally gradual process.

You basically need quantum-scale precision, like nanometers, for that to work."

And many of his administration programs were likely counterproductive, even in the short term. For example, the National Recovery Administration established government mediated cartels to ensure high prices and salaries and thereby fight deflation. Yet the process of structuring specific industries while leaving others to the markets was open at least the appearance of corruption. Moreover, these cartels were highly distortionary and likely harmed economic recoveries. The FDR administration even began to recognize this at the time and quietly wound these down cartels after the NRA was struck down by the courts."

Eg, Trump's earlier administration was certainly important in centering our current bipartisan, hawkish stance towards China."
