# My Substack Comments

This is the source code for a small webpage that displays my substack comments in a searchable format.
You can visit the page at https://matthagy.github.io/substack_comments/

The public demo a custom substack frontend that I'm currently working on.
Since it is public, it only includes my comment.
My personal, private version has all ~200k comments and more features.

Hope to eventually release the custom frontend as open source code so that others can use these features.
